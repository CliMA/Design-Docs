Title = {{Shock capturing with entropy-based artificial viscosity for staggered
   grid discontinuous spectral element method}},
Journal = {{Computers \& Fluids}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{152-163}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a shock capturing technique for a staggered grid
   discontinuous spectral element method (DSEM), which adds localized and
   smooth artificial viscosity to systems of nonlinear conservation laws.
   The artificial diffusivity model used in this work is a modified form of
   the entropy viscosity (EV) presented by Guermond et al. (2011). We
   extend the application of this method to high-order discontinuous
   schemes for the simulation of high speed flows with discontinuities on
   staggered grids. Direct implementation of the entropy viscosity method
   in DSEM leads to a non-smooth artificial viscosity, which in turn leads
   to oscillations and instability of the solution. To smoothen the
   artificial viscosity, the EV method is coupled with a spectral filter
   and an interface treatment technique. The resulting artificial viscosity
   is locally large near discontinuities and transitions smoothly to zero
   in smooth flow regions. The method enables using elements with orders
   higher than unity while avoiding adaptive mesh refinement and preserving
   the locality and compactness of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme.
   The method is implemented for the inviscid compressible Euler equations
   in two space dimensions and its effectiveness is demonstrated through
   its application to a series of benchmark problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper a new approach is presented to increase the time-step size
   for an explicit discontinuous Galerkin numerical method. The attributes
   Of this approach are demonstrated on standard tests for the
   shallow-water equations on the sphere. The addition of multiwavelets to
   the discontinuous Galerkin method, which has the benefit of being
   scalable, flexible, and conservative, provides a hierarchical scale
   structure that can be exploited to improve computational efficiency in
   both the spatial and temporal dimensions. This paper explains how
   combining a multiwavelet discontinuous Galerkin method with
   exact-linear-part time evolution schemes, which can remain stable for
   implicit-sized time steps, can help increase the time-step size for
   shallow-water equations on the sphere.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial viscosity can be combined with a higher-order discontinuous
   Galerkin finite element discretization to resolve a shock layer within a
   single cell. However, when a non-smooth artificial viscosity model is
   employed with an otherwise higher-order approximation,
   element-to-element variations induce oscillations in state gradients and
   pollute the downstream flow. To alleviate these difficulties, this work
   proposes a higher-order, state-based artificial viscosity with an
   associated governing partial differential equation (PDE). In the
   governing PDE, a shock indicator acts as a forcing term while grid-based
   diffusion is added to smooth the resulting artificial viscosity. When
   applied to heat transfer prediction on unstructured meshes in hypersonic
   flows, the PDE-based artificial viscosity is less susceptible to errors
   introduced by grid edges oblique to captured shocks and boundary layers,
   thereby enabling accurate heat transfer predictions. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An innovating approach is proposed to solve vectorial conservation laws
   on curved manifolds using the discontinuous Galerkin method. This new
   approach combines the advantages of the usual approaches described in
   the literature. The vectorial fields are expressed in a unit
   non-orthogonal local tangent basis derived from the polynomial mapping
   of curvilinear triangle elements, while the convective flux functions
   are written is the usual 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The number of
   vectorial components is therefore minimum and the tangency constraint is
   naturally ensured, while the method remains robust and general since not
   relying on a particular parametrization of the manifold. The
   discontinuous Galerkin method is particularly well suited for this
   approach since there is no continuity requirement between elements for
   the tangent basis definition. The possible discontinuities of this basis
   are then taken into account in the Riemann solver on inter-element
   interfaces.
   The approach is validated on the sphere, using the shallow water
   equations for computing standard atmospheric benchmarks. In particular,
   the Williamson test cases are used to analyze the impact of the geometry
   on the convergence rates for discretization error. The propagation of
   gravity waves is eventually computed on non-conventional irregular
   curved manifolds to illustrate the robustness and generality of the
   method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

We will in particular concentrate on a singular limit of weakly compressible flows when the Mach number Mâª1. In order to efficiently resolve slow dynamics we split the whole nonlinear system in a stiff linear part governing the acoustic and gravity waves and a non-stiff nonlinear part that models nonlinear advection effects. For time discretization we use a special class of the so-called globally stiffly accurate IMEX schemes and approximate the stiff linear operator implicitly and the non-stiff nonlinear operator explicitly. For spatial discretization the finite volume approximation is used with the central and Rusanov/LaxâFriedrichs numerical fluxes for the linear and nonlinear subsystem, respectively. In the case of a constant background potential temperature we prove theoretically that the method is asymptotically consistent and asymptotically stable uniformly with respect to small Mach number. We also analyze experimentally convergence rates in the singular limit when the Mach number tends to zero."

Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{A discontinuous Galerkin model solving the shallow-water equations on
   the sphere is presented. It captures the dynamically varying key aspects
   of the flows by having the advantageous ability to locally modify the
   mesh as well as the order of interpolation within each element. The
   computational load is efficiently distributed among processors in
   parallel using a weighted recursive coordinate bisection strategy. A
   simple error estimator, based on the discontinuity of the variables at
   the interfaces between elements, is used to select the elements to be
   refined or coarsened. The flows are expressed in three-dimensional
   Cartesian coordinates, but tangentially constrained to the sphere by
   adding a Lagrange multiplier to the system of equations. The model is
   validated on classic atmospheric test cases and on the simulation of the
   February 2010 Chilean tsunami propagation. The proposed multiscale
   strategy is able to reduce the computational time by an order of
   magnitude on the tsunami simulation, clearly demonstrating its potential
   toward multiresolution three-dimensional oceanic and atmospheric

   three-dimensional faceted shells presents some difficulties which arise
   from the lack of C1 continuity of the geometry.  This paper presents a
   method to circumvent such difficulties based on the existence of a
   mapping from a flat reference configuration to the actual shell.  This
   mapping is used not only to enable meshes to be generated in a
   two-dimensional space, but also to define a stress measure - similar to
   the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress used in large deformation mechanics -
   which can be consistently smoothed over the reference configuration.  A
   preliminary investigation of the method is provided by three simple
   examples.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The paper deals with certain adaptive multilevel methods at the
   confluence of nested multigrid methods and iterative methods based on
   the cascade principle of {[}10]. From the multigrid point of view, no
   correction cycles are needed; from the cascade principle view, a basic
   iteration method without any preconditioner is used at successive
   refinement levels. For a prescribed error tolerance on the final level,
   more iterations must be spent on coarser grids in order to allow for
   less iterations on finer grids, A first candidate of such a cascadic
   multigrid method was the recently suggested cascadic conjugate gradient
   method of {[}9], in short CCG method, which used the CG method as basic
   iteration method on each level. In {[}18] it has been proven, that the
   CCG method is accurate with optimal complexity for elliptic problems in
   2D and quasi-uniform triangulations, The present paper simplifies that
   theory and extends it to more general basic iteration methods like the
   traditional multigrid smoothers. Moreover, an adaptive control strategy
   for the number of iterations on successive refinement levels for
   possibly highly non-uniform grids is worked out on the basis of a
   posteriori estimates. Numerical tests confirm the efficiency and
   robustness of the cascadic multigrid method.}},

  month = may,
  abstract = {In numerical approximations of nearly hydrostatic flows, a proper
	representation of the dominant hydrostatic balance is of crucial
	importance: unbalanced truncation errors can induce unacceptable
	spurious motions, e.g., in dynamical cores of models for numerical
	weather prediction (NWP) in particular near steep topography. In
	this paper we develop a new strategy for the construction of discretizations
	that are "well-balanced" with respect to dominant hydrostatics. The
	classical idea of formulating the momentum balance in terms of deviations
	of pressure from a balanced background distribution is realized here
	through local, time dependent hydrostatic reconstructions. Balanced
	discretizations of the pressure gradient and of the gravitation source
	term are achieved through a "discrete Archimedes' buoyancy principle".
	This strategy is applied to extend an explicit standard finite volume
	Godunov-type scheme for compressible flows with minimal modifications.
	The resulting method has the following features: (i) It inherits
	its conservation properties from the underlying base scheme. (ii)
	It is exactly balanced, even on curvilinear grids, for a large class
	of near-hydrostatic flows. (iii) It solves the full compressible
	flow equations without reference to a background state that is defined
	for an entire vertical column of air. (iv) It is robust with respect
	to details of the implementation, such as the choice of slope limiting
	functions, or the particularities of boundary condition discretizations.},

Journal = {{SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{305-327}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the numerical solution of PDEs with blow-up
   for which scaling invariance plays a natural role in describing the
   underlying solution structures. It is a challenging numerical problem to
   capture the qualitative behaviour in the blow-up region, and the use of
   nonuniform meshes is essential. We consider moving mesh methods for
   which the mesh is determined using so-called moving mesh partial
   differential equations (MMPDEs). Specifically, the underlying PDE and
   the MMPDE are solved for the blow-up solution and the computational mesh
   simultaneously. Motivated by the desire for the MMPDE to preserve the
   scaling invariance of the underlying problem, we study the effect of
   different choices of MMPDEs and monitor functions. It is shown that for
   suitable ones the MMPDE solution evolves towards a (moving) mesh which
   close to the blow-up point automatically places the mesh points in such
   a manner that the ignition kernel, which is well known to be a natural
   coordinate in describing the behaviour of blow-up, approaches a constant
   as t --> T (the blow-up time). Several numerical examples are given to
   verify the theory for these MMPDE methods and to illustrate their
   efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{We present an r-adaptive finite element method for solving time
   dependent partial differential equations. A moving mesh partial
   differential equation, or MMPDE, is used to move the (unstructured) mesh
   in time. A key to the application of the MMPDE to unstructured mesh
   movement is to define a computational domain and then compute the
   corresponding computational mesh as the image of an initial mesh on the
   given physical domain. The finite element discretization of physical
   PDEs on moving meshes is addressed. Numerical results are presented to
   demonstrate the capability of the mesh movement strategy and the
   r-adaptive finite element method. A fully developed r-adaptive finite
   element method can be expected to be ideally suited to complement the
   currently popular h-p finite element methods and to provide increased
   reliability and efficiency for mesh adaptation. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

  abstract = {The Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM), a numerical technique developed
	in astrophysics for modeling fluid flows with strong shocks and discontinuities
	is adapted for treating sharp gradients in small-scale meteorological
	flows. PPM differs substantially from conventional gridpoint techniques
	in three ways. First, PPM is a finite volume scheme, and thus represents
	physical variables as averages over a grid zone rather than single
	values at discrete points. Second, a unique, monotonic parabola is
	fit to the zone average of each dependent variable using information
	from neighboring zone averages. As shown in a series of one- and
	two-dimensional linear advection experiments, the use of parabolas
	provides for extremely accurate advection, particularly of sharp
	gradients. Furthermore, the monotonicity constraint renders PPM&#39;s
	solutions free from Gibbs oscillations. PPM&#39;s third attribute
	is that each zone boundary is treated as a discontinuity. Using the
	method of characteristic the nonlinear flux of quantities between
	zones is obtained by solving a Riemann problem at each zone boundary
	in alternating one-dimensional sweeps through the grid. This methodology
	provides a highly accurate, physically based solution both in the
	vicinity of sharp gradients and in regions where the flow is smooth.The
	ability of PPM to accurately depict the evolution of sharp gradients
	in small-scale, nonlinear flows is examined by simulating a buoyant
	thermal and a density current in two dimensions. Comparisons made
	against Midpoint cloud models reveal that PPM provides superior solutions
	at equivalent spatial resolution, particularly with regard to resolving
	shear lines that subsequently become unstable. The PPM model has
	excellent mass and energy conservation properties, and exhibits virtually
	no numerical dissipation of resolvable modes. Although PPM is not
	yet as economical as a conventional gridpoint model, we anticipate
	that its efficiency can be greatly improved by modifying the treatment
	of acoustic modes.},

In all cases, favorable comparisons are obtained between G-K-S theory, eigenvalue determination, and numerical simulation. The conventional definition of stability then is sharpened to include only those spatial discretizations that are asymptotically stable (bounded, left half-plane eigenvalues). Many of the higher order schemes that are G-K-S stable are not asymptotically stable. A series of compact fourth- and sixth-order schemes that are both asymptotically and G-K-S stable for the scalar case are then developed. "

Title = {{An Element-based Spectrally Optimized Approximate Inverse Preconditioner
   for the Euler Equations}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a method for constructing an element-by-element sparse
   approximate inverse (SAI) preconditioner designed to be effective in a
   massively parallel spectral element modeling environment involving
   nonsymmetric systems. This new preconditioning approach is based on a
   spectral optimization of a low-resolution preconditioned system matrix.
   We show that the local preconditioning matrices obtained via this
   element-based spectrum-optimized (EBSO) approach may be applied to
   arbitrarily high-resolution versions of the same system matrix without
   appreciable loss of preconditioner performance. We demonstrate the
   performance of the EBSO preconditioning approach using two-dimensional
   spectral element method formulations for a simple linear conservation
   law and for the fully compressible two-dimensional Euler equations with
   various boundary conditions. For the latter model running at
   sufficiently large Courant number, the EBSO preconditioner significantly
   reduces both iteration count and wall-clock time regardless of whether a
   generalized minimum residual (GMRES) or a stabilized biconjugate
   gradient (BICGSTAB) iterative scheme is employed. To assess the value
   added by this new preconditioning approach, we compare its performance
   against two other equally parallel SAI preconditioning methods:
   low-order Chebyshev generalized least-squares polynomials and an
   element-based variant of the well-known Frobenius norm optimization
   preconditioner which we also develop here. The EBSO preconditioner
   significantly outperforms both the Chebyshev polynomials and the
   element-based Frobenius-norm-optimized preconditioner regardless of
   whether the GMRES or the BICGSTAB iterative scheme is employed.
   Moreover, when the EBSO preconditioner is combined with the Chebyshev
   polynomial method dramatic reductions in iterations per time-step can be
   achieved while still achieving a significant reduction in wall-clock
   time.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a preconditioner that can be both constructed and applied
   using only the ability to apply the underlying operator. Such a
   preconditioner can be very attractive in scenarios where one has a
   highly efficient parallel code for applying the operator. Our method
   constructs a polynomial preconditioner using a nonlinear least squares
   (NLLS) algorithm. We show that this polynomial-based NLLS-optimized
   (PBNO) preconditioner significantly improves the performance of a
   discontinuous Galerkin (DG) compressible Euler equation model when run
   in an implicit-explicit time integration mode; note that IMEX methods
   are valuable only for low Mach number flows. The PBNO preconditioner
   achieves significant reduction in GMRES iteration counts and model
   wall-clock time, and significantly outperforms several existing types of
   generalized (linear) least squares polynomial preconditioners.
   Comparisons of the ability of the PBNO preconditioner to improve DG
   model performance when employing the Stabilized Biconjugate Gradient
   algorithm (BICGS) and the basic Richardson iteration are also included.
   In particular, we show that higher order PBNO preconditioning of the
   Richardson iteration (run in a dot product free mode) makes the
   algorithm competitive with GMRES and BICGS in a serial computing
   environment. Because the NLLS-based algorithm used to construct the PBNO
   preconditioner can handle both positive definite and complex spectra
   without any need for algorithm modification, we suggest that the PBNO
   preconditioner is, for certain types of problems, an attractive
   alternative to existing polynomial preconditioners based on linear
   least-squares methods.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The non-hydrostatic (NH) compressible Euler equations for dry atmosphere
   were solved in a simplified two-dimensional (2-D) slice framework
   employing a spectral element method (SEM) for the horizontal
   discretization and a finite difference method (FDM) for the vertical
   discretization. By using horizontal SEM, which decomposes the physical
   domain into smaller pieces with a small communication stencil, a high
   level of scalability can be achieved. By using vertical FDM, an easy
   method for coupling the dynamics and existing physics packages can be
   provided. The SEM uses high-order nodal basis functions associated with
   Lagrange polynomials based on Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) quadrature
   points. The FDM employs a third-order upwind-biased scheme for the
   vertical flux terms and a centered finite difference scheme for the
   vertical derivative and integral terms. For temporal integration, a
   time-split, third-order Runge-Kutta (RK3) integration technique was
   applied. The Euler equations that were used here are in flux form based
   on the hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate. The equations are the
   same as those used in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model,
   but a hybrid sigma-pressure vertical coordinate was implemented in this
   model.
   We validated the model by conducting the widely used standard tests:
   linear hydrostatic mountain wave, tracer advection, and gravity wave
   over the Schar-type mountain, as well as density current,
   inertia-gravity wave, and rising thermal bubble. The results from these
   tests demonstrated that the model using the horizontal SEM and the
   vertical FDM is accurate and robust provided sufficient diffusion is
   applied. The results with various horizontal resolutions also showed
   convergence of second-order accuracy due to the accuracy of the time
   integration scheme and that of the vertical direction, although
   high-order basis functions were used in the horizontal. By using the 2-D
   slice model, we effectively showed that the combined spatial
   discretization method of the spectral element and finite difference
   methods in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, offers
   a viable method for development of an NH dynamical core.}},

  abstract = {We identify and study an LDG-hybridizable Galerkin method, which is
	not an LDG method, for second-order elliptic problems in several
	space dimensions with remarkable convergence properties. Unlike all
	other known discontinuous Galerkin methods using polynomials of degree
	$ k\ge0$ for both the potential as well as the flux, the order of
	convergence in $ L^2$ of both unknowns is $ k+1$. Moreover, both
	the approximate potential as well as its numerical trace superconverge
	in $ L^2$-like norms, to suitably chosen projections of the potential,
	with order $ k+2$. This allows the application of element-by-element
	postprocessing of the approximate solution which provides an approximation
	of the potential converging with order $ k+2$ in $ L^2$. The method
	can be thought to be in between the hybridized version of the Raviart-Thomas
	and that of the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini mixed methods.},

Abstract = {{Strong stability preserving (SSP) time discretizations preserve the
   monotonicity properties satisfied by the spatial discretization when
   coupled with the first order forward Euler, under a certain time-step
   restriction. The search for high order strong stability preserving
   time-stepping methods with high order and large allowable time-step has
   been an active area of research. It is known that implicit SSP
   Runge-Kutta methods exist only up to sixth order; however, if we
   restrict ourselves to solving only linear autonomous problems, the order
   conditions simplify and we can find implicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods of
   any linear order. In the current work we find implicit SSP Runge-Kutta
   methods with high linear order and nonlinear orders , that are optimal
   in terms of allowable SSP time-step. Next, we formulate a novel
   optimization problem for implicit-explicit (IMEX) SSP Runge-Kutta
   methods and find optimized IMEX SSP Runge-Kutta pairs that have high
   linear order and nonlinear orders up to . We also find implicit methods
   with large linear stability regions that pair with known explicit SSP
   Runge-Kutta methods. These methods are then tested on sample problems to
   demonstrate the sharpness of the SSP coefficient and the typical
   behavior of these methods on test problems.}},

Abstract = {{Various simplifications of the fully compressible inviscid (Euler)
   equations have been made over the years to filter out
   rapidly-propagating acoustic oscillations, resulting in various
   anelastic, hydrostatic and pseudo-incompressible equation sets. The
   principal tool used to develop approximate equation sets, and to assess
   their validity as a function of flow regime, has been scale analysis
   which has proven quite Subtle to apply. Here it is shown that
   normal-mode analysis provides a useful complementary tool for assessing
   the validity of the above-mentioned approximate equation sets for both
   small- and large-scale flows, and leads to the following conclusions.
   Whilst of key importance for small-scale theoretical studies and process
   modelling, the anelastic equations are not recommended for either
   operational numerical weather prediction or climate simulation at any
   scale. The pseudo-incompressible set appears to he viable for numerical
   weather prediction, but only at short horizontal scales. For global
   non-hydrostatic modelling, only the fully compressible equations are
   suitable. Advances in numerical techniques in the past decade allow
   these to be integrated in a computationally efficient manner.}},

Abstract = {{We first demonstrate the parallel performance of the dynamical core of a
   spectral element atmospheric model. The model uses continuous Galerkin
   spectral elements to discretize the surface of the Earth, coupled with
   finite differences in the radial direction. Results are presented from
   two distributed memory, mesh interconnect supercomputers (ASCI Red and
   BlueGene/L), using a two-dimensional space filling curve domain
   decomposition. Better than 80\% parallel efficiency is obtained for
   fixed grids on up to 8938 processors. These runs represent the largest
   processor counts ever achieved for a geophysical application. They show
   that the upcoming Red Storm and BlueGene/L supercomputers are well
   suited for performing global atmospheric simulations with a 10 km
   average grid spacing. We then demonstrate the accuracy of the method by
   performing a full three-dimensional mesh refinement convergence study,
   using the primitive equations to model breaking Rossby waves on the
   polar vortex. Due to the excellent parallel performance, the model is
   run at several resolutions up to 36 km with 200 levels using only modest
   computing resources. Isosurfaces of scaled potential vorticity exhibit
   complex dynamical features, e.g. a primary potential vorticity tongue;
   and a secondary instability causing roll-up into a ring of five smaller
   subvortices. As the resolution is increased, these features are shown to
   converge while potential vorticity gradients steepen.}},

abstract ={The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 5 includes a spectral element dynamical core option from NCAR’s High-Order Method Modeling Environment. It is a continuous Galerkin spectral finite-element method designed for fully unstructured quadrilateral meshes. The current configurations in CAM are based on the cubed-sphere grid. The main motivation for including a spectral element dynamical core is to improve the scalability of CAM by allowing quasi-uniform grids for the sphere that do not require polar filters. In addition, the approach provides other state-of-the-art capabilities such as improved conservation properties. Spectral elements are used for the horizontal discretization, while most other aspects of the dynamical core are a hybrid of well-tested techniques from CAM’s finite volume and global spectral dynamical core options. Here we first give an overview of the spectral element dynamical core as used in CAM. We then give scalability and performance results from CAM running with three different dynamical core options within the Community Earth System Model, using a pre-industrial time-slice configuration. We focus on high-resolution simulations, using 1/4 degree, 1/8 degree, and T341 spectral truncation horizontal grids.},

Abstract = {{A spectral multidomain penalty method model has been developed for the
   simulation of high Reynolds number localized stratified turbulence. This
   is the first time that a penalty method, with a particular focus on
   subdomain interface treatment, has been used with a multidomain scheme
   to simulate incompressible flows. The temporal discretization ensures
   maximum temporal accuracy by combining third order stiffly stable and
   backward differentiation schemes with a high-order boundary condition
   for the pressure. In the non-periodic vertical direction, a spectral
   multidomain discretization is used and its stability for under-resolved
   simulations at high Reynolds numbers is ensured through use of penalty
   techniques, spectral filtering and strong adaptive interfacial
   averaging. The penalty method is implemented in different formulations
   for both the explicit non-linear term advancement and the implicit
   treatment of the viscous terms. The multidomain model is validated by
   comparing results of simulations of the mid-to-late time stratified
   turbulent wake with non-zero net momentum to the corresponding
   laboratory data for a towed sphere. The model replicates correctly the
   characteristic vorticity and internal wave structure of the stratified
   wake and exhibits robust agreement with experiments in terms of the
   temporal power laws in the evolution of mean profile characteristic
   velocity and lengthscales. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A nonhydrostatic extension to the Pennsylvania State University-NCAR
   Mesoscale Model is presented. This new version employs reference
   pressure as the basis for a terrain-following vertical coordinate and
   the fully compressible system of equations. In combination with the
   existing initialization techniques and physics of the current
   hydrostatic model, this provides a model capable of real-data
   simulations on any scale, limited only by data resolution and quality
   and by computer resources.
   The model uses pressure perturbation and temperature as prognostic
   variables as well as a B-grid staggering in contrast to most current
   nonhydrostatic models. The compressible equations are solved with a
   split-time-step approach where sound waves are treated semi-implicitly
   on the shorter step. Numerical techniques and finite differencing are
   described.
   Two-dimensional tests of flow over a bell-shaped hill on a range of
   scales were carried out with the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models
   to contrast the two and to verify the dynamics of the new version.
   Several three-dimensional real-data simulations show the potential use
   of grid-nesting applications whereby the model is initialized from a
   coarser hydrostatic or nonhydrostatic model output by interpolation to
   a smaller grid area of typically between two and four times finer
   resolution. This approach is illustrated by a simulation of a cold
   front within a developing midlatitude cyclone, and a comparison of the
   front to observations of similar features.
   The cold-frontal boundary was sharply defined at low levels and
   consisted of narrow linear updraft cores. At 2-4-km altitude this
   structure gave way to a more diffuse boundary with apparent mixing.
   Mechanisms are presented to explain these features in terms of inertial
   and shearing instability. Convection embedded in the frontal band
   formed a prefrontal line at later stages.
   Finally, sensitivity studies showed that the frontal band owed its
   narrowness to the concentrating effect of latent heating. The frontal
   ascending branch was supplied by a strong easterly ageostrophic flow in
   the warm sector.}},

Abstract = {{Triangular spectral elements offer high accuracy in complex geometries,
   but solving the related matrix problem can be cumbersome and time
   consuming. In restricted applications, recent developments have led to a
   family of discontinuous Galerkin formulations in which each element of
   the mesh leads to a local matrix problem. The main restriction is that
   all the fluid equations must be prognostic and solved explicitly in
   time. Such is the case for a hydrostatic ocean with a free surface and a
   Boussinesq approximation. Furthermore, there is a strong need for
   variable resolution in ocean modeling since the width of synoptic eddies
   and strong western currents such as the Gulf Stream are nearly two
   orders of magnitude smaller than the typical width of an ocean.
   Triangular elements also offer high flexibility for the adaptive
   problem. Some applications for shallow water test case problems are
   shown with comparisons to a traditional finite-difference model and to a
   finite-element coastal ocean model. These comparisons are made in
   rectangular domains where the finite-difference method has an inherent
   advantage. For a nonlinear wind-driven application, the spectral element
   model proved to be more expensive to run at reasonable accuracy than a
   second-order-accurate finite-difference model. Nonetheless the spectral
   element model appears to be a large improvement compared to
   finite-element models of low order, an encouraging result. A simple
   adaptive strategy is also investigated, with favorable results.}},

Abstract = {{Two commonly used types of high-order-accuracy element-based schemes,
   collocation-based spectral multidomain penalty methods (SMPM) and nodal
   discontinuous Galerkin methods (DGM), are compared in the framework of
   the inviscid shallow water equations. Differences and similarities in
   formulation are identified, with the primary difference being the
   dissipative term in the Rusanov form of the numerical flux for the DGM
   that provides additional numerical stability; however, it should be
   emphasized that to arrive at this equivalence between SMPM and DGM
   requires making specific choices in the construction of both methods;
   these choices are addressed. In general, both methods offer a multitude
   of choices in the penalty terms used to introduce boundary conditions
   and stabilize the numerical solution. The resulting specialized class of
   SMPM and DGM are then applied to a suite of six commonly considered
   geophysical flow test cases, three linear and three non-linear; we also
   include results for a classical continuous Galerkin (i.e., spectral
   element) method for comparison. Both the analysis and numerical
   experiments show that the SMPM and DGM are essentially identical; both
   methods can be shown to be equivalent for very special choices of
   quadrature rules and Riemann solvers in the DGM along with special
   choices in the type of penalty term in the SMPM. Although we only focus
   our studies on the inviscid shallow water equations the results
   presented should be applicable to other systems of nonlinear hyperbolic
   equations (such as the compressible Euler equations) and extendable to
   the compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, where
   viscous terms are included. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in complex domains is
   dependent upon the availability of fast solvers for sparse linear
   systems. For unsteady incompressible flows, the pressure operator is
   the leading contributor to stiffness, as the characteristic propagation
   speed is infinite. In the context of operator splitting formulations,
   it is the pressure solve which is the most computationally challenging,
   despite its elliptic origins. We examine several preconditioners for
   the consistent L-2 Poisson operator arising in the P-N - PN-2 spectral
   element formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We
   develop a finite element-based additive Schwarz preconditioner using
   overlapping subdomains plus a coarse grid projection operator which is
   applied directly to the pressure on the interior Gauss points. For
   large two-dimensional problems this approach can yield as much as a
   fivefold reduction in simulation time over previously employed methods
   based upon deflation. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{A nonhydrostatic, fully compressible spectral element (SE) model is
   evaluated in a series of two-dimensional idealized simulations. A dry
   formulation of the model is evaluated for a linear hydrostatic
   mountain-wave case, and a version with moisture is tested for a squall
   line. In the SE method, two setup parameters control the spatial
   resolution: the number of elements (h) and the polynomial order (p) of
   the basis functions. In this paper, the h=p parameter space is
   systematically explored, with the average horizontal resolution (Delta
   x) varying from 0.2 to 10 km in 91 simulations.
   The dry experiments are evaluated using an analytic solution. The ratio
   of Delta x/a < 0.2, where a is the mountain half-width, is sufficient to
   accurately resolve the mountain wave. Accuracy. computational cost, and
   convergence to the analytic solution are evaluated and compared to a
   second-order finite-difference (FD) model. The increase in computational
   cost by refining the spatial resolution yields a significant accuracy
   gain for the SE, with only a marginal improvement for the FD model.
   The squall line is evaluated across the control parameter space by
   assessing three integrated quantities: total precipitation accumulation,
   maximum vertical velocity, and maximum precipitation rate. The squall
   line is adequately resolved with Delta x < 2 km and p > 5. There is
   little variation in metrics due to the varying nodal spacing within an
   element at the same average Delta x. When the spatial resolution is
   refined, the analyzed metrics no longer converge. The nonlinear nature
   of moist convection is responsible for this resolution dependence as a
   result of localized buoyancy sources, evident in the vertical velocity
   spectrum.}},

   This means that the refined mesh, like the original, is formed of only
   quadrilateral elements that intersect strictly along edges or at
   vertices, i.e., vertices of one quadrilateral element do not lie in an
   edge of another quadrilateral. Elements are refined using templates
   based on 1:3 refinement of edges. It is demonstrated that by careful
   design of the refinement and coarsening strategy, high quality elements
   can be maintained in the refined mesh. The method is demonstrated on a
   number of examples with dynamically changing refinement regions.}},

  abstract = {The primary interest of the paper is to apply a two-time-level split
	explicit time scheme developed by one of the authors to the Lokal-Modell
	(LM) of the German Weather Service (DWD). This model belongs to the
	operational NWP system at DWD, which makes it particularly interesting
	for this study. To better understand the implementation of this time
	scheme in a compressible nonhydrostatic model type, and so in the
	LM, a linear analysis is presented demonstrating how the equations
	are to be split up into fast- and slow-mode parts. For the fast-mode
	part, this analysis demonstrates how the connected short time-step
	scheme is necessary for a consistent treatment of gravity modes on
	the one side and a sufficient damping of acoustic modes on the other
	side. An extended linear stability analysis for the new splitting
	scheme follows then to establish its application in a full model.
	An advantage of the given time scheme is that any forward-in-time
	and stable advection scheme can be linked with the reformulated fast-mode
	equation part. A Runge–Kutta third-order-in-time and second-order-in-space
	scheme (RK3/2) has been applied to the horizontal advection, and
	the vertical advection terms are treated implicitly. A new consistent
	lower boundary condition and a radiative upper boundary condition
	are taken into account. Steady airflow simulations over an isolated
	mountain (Schär test) and the successful incorporation of the Klemp–Durran–Bougeault
	radiative upper boundary condition in the vertically implicit fast-mode
	scheme confirm the given approach as necessary and effective for
	the application of the time scheme. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright

Abstract = {{In this work, we discuss two different but related aspects of the
   development of efficient discontinuous Galerkin methods on hybrid
   element grids for the computational modeling of gas dynamics in complex
   geometries or with adapted grids. In the first part, a recursive
   construction of different nodal sets for hp finite elements is
   presented. They share the property that the nodes along the sides of the
   two-dimensional elements and along the edges of the three-dimensional
   elements are the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points. The different nodal
   elements are evaluated by computing the Lebesgue constants of the
   corresponding Vandermonde matrix. In the second part, these nodal
   elements are applied within the modal discontinuous Galerkin framework.
   We still use a modal based formulation, but introduce a nodal based
   integration technique to reduce computational cost in the spirit of
   pseudospectral methods. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on
   several large scale applications and discuss its use in a recently
   developed space-time expansion discontinuous Galerkin scheme. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method formed by fusing
   the Lagrange-Galerkin and spectral element methods. The
   Lagrange-Galerkin method traces the characteristic curves of the
   solution and, consequently, is very well suited for resolving the
   nonlinearities introduced by the advection operator of the fluid
   dynamics equations. Spectral element methods are essentially higher
   order finite element methods that exhibit spectral (exponential)
   convergence, provided that the solution is a smooth function. By
   combining these two methods, a numerical scheme can be constructed that
   resolves, with extremely high precision, the nonlinearities of the
   advection terms and the smooth regions of the flow generated by the
   diffusion terms. This paper describes the construction of the
   Lagrange-Galerkin spectral element method which permits the use of any
   grid type including unstructured grids. The only restriction at the
   moment is that the grid elements be quadrilaterals. The stability
   analysis of both methods demonstrates why these two methods are so
   powerful individually and how their fusion leads to an improved scheme.
   The Lagrange-Galerkin spectral element method is validated using the 1D
   and 2D advection and advection-diffusion equations. The results of the
   stability analysis and the numerical experiments demonstrate the
   utility of such an approach. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows how to obtain accurate and efficient trajectory
   calculations for spherical geodesic grids in Cartesian space.
   Determination of the departure points is essential to
   characteristic-based methods that trace the value of a function to the
   foot of the characteristics and then either integrate or interpolate at
   this location. In this paper, the departure points are all computed in
   relation to the spherical geodesic grids that are composed of a disjoint
   set of unstructured equilateral triangles. Interpolating and
   noninterpolating trajectory calculation approaches are both illustrated
   and the accuracy of both methods are compared. The noninterpolating
   method of McGregor results in the most accurate trajectories. The
   challenge in using McGregor's method on unstructured triangular grids
   lies in the computation of the derivatives required in the high-order
   terms of the Taylor series expansion. This paper extends McGregor's
   method to unstructured triangular grids by describing an accurate and
   efficient method for constructing the derivatives in an element by
   element approach typical of finite element methods. An order of accuracy
   analysis reveals that these numerical derivatives are second-order
   accurate.}},

Abstract = {{The spectral element method for the two-dimensional shallow water
   equations on the sphere is presented. The equations are written in
   conservation form and the domains are discretized using quadrilateral
   elements obtained from the generalized icosahedral grid introduced
   previously (Giraldo FX. Lagrange-Galerkin methods on spherical geodesic
   grids: the shallow water equations. Journal of Computational Physics
   2000; 160: 336-368). The equations are written in Cartesian co-ordinates
   that introduce an additional momentum equation, but the pole
   singularities disappear. This paper represents a departure from
   previously published work on solving the shallow water equations on the
   sphere in that the equations are all written, discretized, and solved in
   three-dimensional Cartesian space. Because the equations are written in
   a three-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinate system, the algorithm
   simplifies into the integration of surface elements on the sphere from
   the fully three-dimensional equations. A mapping (Song Ch, Wolf JP. The
   scaled boundary finite element method-alias consistent infinitesimal
   finite element cell method-for diffusion. International Journal for
   Numerical Methods in Engineering 1999; 45: 1403-1431) which simplifies
   these computations is described and is shown to contain the Eulerian
   version of the method introduced previously by Giraldo (Journal of
   Computational Physics 2000; 160: 336-368) for the special case of
   triangular elements. The significance of this mapping is that although
   the equations are written in Cartesian co-ordinates, the mapping takes
   into account the curvature of the high-order spectral elements, thereby
   allowing the elements to lie entirely on the surface of the sphere. In
   addition, using this mapping simplifies all of the three-dimensional
   spectral-type finite element surface integrals because any of the
   typical two-dimensional planar finite element or spectral element basis
   functions found in any textbook (for example, Huebner et al. The Finite
   Element Method for Engineers. Wiley, New York, 1995; Karniadakis GE,
   Sherwin SJ. Spectral/hp Element Methods for CFD. Oxford University
   Press, New York, 1999; and Szabo B, Babuska I. Finite Element Analysis.
   Wiley, New York, 1991) can be used. Results for six test cases are
   presented to confirm the accuracy and stability of the new method.

Abstract = {{A spectral element semi-Lagrangian (SESL) method for the shallow water
   equations on the sphere is presented. The sphere is discretized using a
   hexahedral grid although any grid imaginable can be used as long as it
   is comprised of quadrilaterals. The equations are written in Cartesian
   coordinates to eliminate the pole singularity which plagues the
   equations in spherical coordinates. In a previous paper {[}Int. J.
   Numer. Methods Fluids 35 (2001) 869] we showed how to construct an
   explicit Eulerian spectral element (SE) model on the sphere; we now
   extend this work to a semi-Lagrangian formulation. The novelty of the
   Lagrangian formulation presented is that the high order SE basis
   functions are used as the interpolation functions for evaluating the
   values at the Lagrangian departure points. This makes the method not
   only high order accurate but quite general and thus applicable to
   unstructured grids and portable to distributed memory computers. The
   equations are discretized fully implicitly in time in order to avoid
   having to interpolate derivatives at departure points. By incorporating
   the Coriolis terms into the Lagrangian derivative, the block LU
   decomposition of the equations results in a symmetric positive-definite
   pseudo-Helmholtz operator which we solve using the generalized minimum
   residual method (GMRES) with a fast projection method {[}Comput. Methods
   Appl. Mech. Eng. 163 (1998) 193]. Results for eight test cases are
   presented to confirm the accuracy and stability of the method. These
   results show that SESL yields the same accuracy as an Eulerian spectral
   element semi-implicit (SESI) while allowing for time-steps 10 times as
   large and being up to 70\% more efficient. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A new dynamical core for numerical weather prediction (NWP) based on

   departure from previously published work on solving the atmospheric
   primitive equations in that the horizontal operators are all written,

   Cartesian space are that the pole singularity that plagues the

   including latitude-longitude, icosahedral, hexahedral, and adaptive
   unstructured grids; and the conversion to a semi-Lagrangian formulation
   is easily achieved. The main advantage of using the spectral element
   method is that the horizontal operators can be approximated by local
   high-order elements while scaling efficiently on distributed-memory
   computers. In order to validate the 3D global atmospheric spectral
   element model, results are presented for seven test cases: three
   barotropic tests that confirm the exponential accuracy of the
   horizontal operators and four baroclinic test cases that validate the
   full 3D primitive hydrostatic equations. These four baroclinic test
   cases are the Rossby-Haurwitz wavenumber 4, the Held-Suarez test, and
   the Jablonowski-Williamson balanced initial state and baroclinic
   instability tests. Comparisons with four operational NWP and climate
   models demonstrate that the spectral element model is at least as
   accurate as spectral transform models while scaling linearly on

	dynamical core is based on a high-order spectral element (SE) method
	in space and uses semi-implicit methods in time based on either the
	traditional second-order leapfrog (LF2) or second-order backward
	difference formulas (BDF2). The novelties of NSEAM are: it is geometrically
	flexible and thereby can accommodate any type of grid; LF2 or BDF2
	are used to construct the semi-implicit method; and the horizontal
	operators are written, discretized, and solved in three-dimensional
	Cartesian space. The semi-implicit NSEAM is validated using: five
	baroclinic test cases; direct comparisons to the explicit version
	of NSEAM which has been extensively tested and the results previously
	reported in the literature; and comparisons with operational weather
	prediction and well-established climate models. A comparison with
	the US Navy's spectral transform global forecast model illustrates
	that NSEAM is 60% faster on an IBM SP4 using 96 processors for the
	current operational resolution of T239 L30. However, NSEAM can accommodate
	many more processors while continuing to scale efficiently even at
	higher grid resolutions. In fact, we show that at T498 L60, NSEAM

Abstract = {{The cornerstone of nodal spectral-element methods is the co-location of
   the interpolation and integration points, yielding a diagonal mass
   matrix that is efficient for time-integration. On quadrilateral
   elements, Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points are both good interpolation and
   integration points; on triangles, analogous points have not yet been
   found. In this paper, a promising set of points for the triangle that
   were only available for polynomial degree N <= 5 are used. However, the
   derivation of these points is generalized to obtain degree N <= 7
   points, which are referred to as cubature points because their
   selection is based on their integration accuracy. The
   diagonal-mass-matrix (DMM) triangular-spectral-element (TSE) method
   based on these points can be used for any set of equations and any type
   of domain. Because these cubature points integrate up to order 2N along
   the element boundaries and yield a diagonal mass matrix, they allow the
   triangular spectral elements to compete with quadrilateral spectral
   elements in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, while offering more
   geometric flexibility in the choice of grids. It is shown how to
   implement this DMM TSE for a variety of applications involving elliptic
   and hyperbolic equations on different domains. The DMM TSE method
   yields comparable accuracy to the exact integration (non-DMM) TSE
   method, while being far more efficient for time-dependent problems.}},

	fluid flow which are of importance in nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric
	modeling. We study three different forms of the governing equations
	using seven test cases. Three test cases involve flow over mountains
	which require the implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions,
	while one test requires viscous terms (density current). Including
	viscous stresses into finite difference, finite element, or spectral
	element models poses no additional challenges; however, including
	these terms to either finite volume or discontinuous Galerkin models
	requires the introduction of additional machinery because these methods
	were originally designed for first-order operators. We use the local
	discontinuous Galerkin method to overcome this obstacle. The seven
	test cases show that all of our models yield good results. The main
	conclusion is that equation set 1 (non-conservation form) does not
	perform as well as sets 2 and 3 (conservation forms). For the density
	current (viscous), the SE and DG models using set 3 (mass and total
	energy) give less dissipative results than the other equation sets;
	based on these results we recommend set 3 for the development of
	future multiscale research codes. In addition, the fact that set
	3 conserves both mass and energy up to machine precision motives
	us to pursue this equation set for the development of future mesoscale
	models. For the bubble and mountain tests, the DG models performed
	better. Based on these results and due to its conservation properties
	we recommend the DG method. In the worst case scenario, the DG models
	are 50% slower than the non-conservative SE models. In the best case
	scenario, the DG models are just as efficient as the conservative
	SE models.},

Abstract = {{We extend the explicit in time high-order triangular discontinuous
   Galerkin (DG) method to semi-implicit (SI) and then apply the algorithm
   to the two-dimensional oceanic shallow water equations; we implement
   high-order SI time-integrators using the backward difference formulas
   from orders one to six. The reason for changing the time-integration
   method from explicit to SI is that explicit methods require a very small
   time step in order to maintain stability, especially for high-order DG
   methods. Changing the time-integration method to SI allows one to
   circumvent the stability criterion due to the gravity waves, which for
   most shallow water applications are the fastest waves in the system (the
   exception being supercritical flow where the Froude number is greater
   than one). The challenge of constructing a SI method for a DG model is
   that the DG machinery requires not only the standard finite element-type
   area integrals, but also the finite volume-type boundary integrals as
   well. These boundary integrals pose the biggest challenge in a SI
   discretization because they require the construction of a Riemann solver
   that is the true linear representation of the nonlinear Riemann problem;
   if this condition is not satisfied then the resulting numerical method
   will not be consistent with the continuous equations. In this paper we
   couple the SI time-integrators with the DG method while maintaining most
   of the usual attributes associated with DG methods such as: high-order
   accuracy (in both space and time), parallel efficiency, excellent
   stability, and conservation. The only property lost is that of a compact
   communication stencil typical of time-explicit DG methods; implicit
   methods will always require a much larger communication stencil. We
   apply the new high-order SI DG method to the shallow water equations and
   show results for many standard test cases of oceanic interest such as:
   standing, Kelvin and Rossby soliton waves, and the Stommel problem. The
   results show that the new high-order SI DG model, that has already been
   shown to yield exponentially convergent solutions in space for smooth
   problems, results in a more efficient model than its explicit
   counterpart. Furthermore, for those problems where the spatial
   resolution is sufficiently high compared with the length scales of the
   flow, the capacity to use high-order (HO) time-integrators is a
   necessary complement to the employment of HO space discretizations,
   since the total numerical error would be otherwise dominated by the time
   discretization error. In fact, in the limit of increasing spatial
   resolution, it makes little sense to use HO spatial discretizations
   coupled with low-order time discretizations. Published in 2009 by John

Abstract = {{We present semi-implicit (implicit-explicit) formulations of the

   nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling include buoyancy terms that require
   special handling if one wishes to extract the Schur complement form of
   the linear implicit problem. We present results for five different
   forms of the compressible NSE and describe in detail how to formulate
   the semi-implicit time-integration method for these equations. Finally,
   we compare all five equations and compare the semi-implicit
   formulations of these equations both using the Schur and No Schur forms
   against an explicit Runge-Kutta method. Our simulations show that, if
   efficiency is the main criterion, it matters which form of the
   governing equations you choose. Furthermore, the semi-implicit
   formulations are faster than the explicit Runge-Kutta method for all
   the tests studied, especially if the Schur form is used. While we have
   used the spectral element method for discretizing the spatial
   operators, the semi-implicit formulations that we derive are directly
   applicable to all other numerical methods. We show results for our five
   semi-implicit models for a variety of problems of interest in
   nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling, including inertia-gravity waves,
   density current (i.e., Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities), and mountain
   test cases; the latter test case requires the implementation of
   nonreflecting boundary conditions. Therefore, we show results for all
   five semi-implicit models using the appropriate boundary conditions
   required in nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling: no-flux (reflecting)
   and nonreflecting boundary conditions (NRBCs). It is shown that the
   NRBCs exert a strong impact on the accuracy and efficiency of the
   models.}},

Abstract = {{We derive an implicit-explicit (IMEX) formalism for the
   three-dimensional (3D) Euler equations that allow a unified
   representation of various nonhydrostatic flow regimes, including cloud
   resolving and mesoscale (flow in a 3D Cartesian domain) as well as
   global regimes (flow in spherical geometries). This general IMEX
   formalism admits numerous types of methods including single-stage
   multistep methods (e.g., Adams methods and backward difference formulas)
   and multistage single-step methods (e.g., additive Runge-Kutta methods).
   The significance of this result is that it allows a numerical model to
   reuse the same machinery for all classes of time-integration methods
   described in this work. We also derive two classes of IMEX methods,
   one-dimensional and 3D, and show that they achieve their expected
   theoretical rates of convergence regardless of the geometry (e. g., 3D
   box or sphere) and introduce a new second-order IMEX Runge-Kutta method
   that performs better than the other second-order methods considered. We
   then compare all the IMEX methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency
   for two types of geophysical fluid dynamics problems: buoyant convection
   and inertia-gravity waves. These results show that the high-order
   time-integration methods yield better efficiency particularly when high

	Variable Methods in Ordinary Differential Equations, Wiley, 1962).
	There results a family of sequences y sub n (h) which approximate
	the exact solution y (x) at the mesh points x = x sub n = a + nh.
	The parameter h plays an essential role in the construction of the
	y sub n (h). Under suitable regularity conditions on f it is proved
	that y sub n (h) has an asymptotic expansion in powers of h, valid
	as h approaches 0+ and n approaches infinity in such a manner that
	x = a + nh remains fixed in (a,b . These results provide a rigorous
	justification for the algorithm of repeated extrapolation to the
	limit in which successive terms of the expansion for the error y
	sub n (h) - y(x) are removed by making use of the knowledge of the
	approximate solutions computed with the values h = 2 to the minus
	m power h sub O, m = 0,1, . . . . The convergence properties of the
	algorithm are discussed in some generality and the theory is verified
	experimentally for a number of classical numerical methods.}

Journal = {{Journal of Computational Physics}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{267}},
Pages = {{176-195}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a new family of optimization based limiters for the h-p
   spectral element method. The native spectral element advection operator
   is oscillatory, but due to its mimetic properties it is locally
   conservative and has a monotone property with respect to element
   averages. We exploit this property to construct locally conservative
   quasimonotone and sign-preserving limiters. The quasimonotone limiter
   prevents all overshoots and undershoots at the element level, but is not
   strictly non-oscillatory. It also maintains quasimonotonicity even with
   the addition of a dissipation term such as viscosity or hyperviscosity.
   The limiters are based on a least-squares formulation with equality and
   inequality constraints and are local to each element. We evaluate the
   new limiters using a deformational flow test case for advection on the
   surface of the sphere. We focus on mesh refinement for moderate (p = 3)
   and high order (p = 6) elements. As expected, the spectral element
   method obtains its formal order of accuracy for smooth problems without
   limiters. For advection of fields with cusps and discontinuities, the
   high order convergence is lost, but in all cases, p = 6 outperforms p =
   3 for the same degrees of freedom. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{Geoscientific Model Development}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2803-2816}},
Abstract = {{We evaluate the performance of the Community Atmosphere Model's (CAM)
   spectral element method on variable-resolution grids using the
   shallow-water equations in spherical geometry. We configure the method
   as it is used in CAM, with dissipation of grid scale variance,
   implemented using hyperviscosity. Hyperviscosity is highly scale
   selective and grid independent, but does require a resolution-dependent
   coefficient. For the spectral element method with variable-resolution
   grids and highly distorted elements, we obtain the best results if we
   introduce a tensor-based hyperviscosity with tensor coefficients tied to
   the eigenvalues of the local element metric tensor. The tensor
   hyperviscosity is constructed so that, for regions of uniform
   resolution, it matches the traditional constant-coefficient
   hyperviscosity. With the tensor hyperviscosity, the large-scale solution
   is almost completely unaffected by the presence of grid refinement. This
   later point is important for climate applications in which long term
   climatological averages can be imprinted by stationary inhomogeneities
   in the truncation error. We also evaluate the robustness of the approach
   with respect to grid quality by considering unstructured conforming
   quadrilateral grids generated with a well-known grid-generating toolkit
   and grids generated by SQuadGen, a new open source alternative which
   produces lower valence nodes.}},

   conservation laws is described (entropy viscosity method). The novelty
   is that a nonlinear viscosity based on the local size of an entropy

   or systems supplemented with one or more entropy inequalities and does
   not depend on the mesh type and polynomial approximation. Various
   benchmark problems are solved with finite elements, spectral elements
   and Fourier series to illustrate the capability of the proposed method.

Abstract = {{The coupling of subsystems in a hierarchical modelling approach leads to
   different time constants in the dynamical simulation of technical
   systems, Multirate schemes exploit the different time scales by using
   different time steps for the subsystems. The stiffness of the system or
   at, least of some subsystems in chemical reaction kinetics or network
   analysis, for example, forbids the use of explicit integral ion schemes.
   To cope with stiff problems, we introduce multirate schemes based on
   partitioned Runge-Kutta methods which avoid the coupling between active
   and latent components based on interpolating and extrapolating state
   variables. Order conditions and test results for such a lower order MPRK
   method are presented.}},

Title = {{On the Existence of Explicit hp-Finite Element Methods using
   Gauss-Lobatto Integration on the Triangle}},
Journal = {{SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1304-1318}},
Abstract = {{Spectral-element simulations on quadrilaterals and hexahedra rely on
   the Gauss-Lobatto (GL) integration rule to enable explicit simulations
   with optimal spatial convergence rates. In this work, it is proved that
   a similar integration rule does not exist on triangles. The following
   properties of the rule are sought: a (p+1)(p+2)/2 point integration
   rule capable of exactly integrating the space given by T (2p - 1) =
   \{x(m)y(n) vertical bar 0 <= m, n; m + n <= 2p - 1\}, where p is an
   integer; integration points located at each of the triangle vertices; p
   - 1 integration points located on each side; and (p - 1)(p - 2)/2
   integration points located in the interior of the element. The proof
   hinges on the fact that the existence of such a rule implies the
   existence of a nodal basis with an approximate diagonal mass matrix
   that can be inverted to obtain exact Galerkin projections of functions
   in T ( p - 1). The proof shows that vertex functions of a basis having
   this property exist and are unique, but on a triangle these functions
   are not nodal, and therefore the GL rule does not exist. In spite of
   this, the existence of the vertex functions indicates that there may be
   a nonnodal basis that has the above property. This basis would enable
   explicit hp-finite element simulations on the triangle with optimal
   spatial accuracy. The methodology developed in the paper gives insight
   into a possible way to find such a basis.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the need to solve linear systems arising from problems posed
   on extremely large, unstructured grids, there has been a recent
   resurgence of interest in algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG is attractive
   in that it holds out the possibility of multigrid-like performance on
   unstructured grids. The sheer size of many modem physics and simulation
   problems has led to the development of massively parallel computers, and
   has sparked much research into developing algorithms for them.
   Parallelizing AMG is a difficult task, however. While much of the AMG
   method parallelizes readily, the process of coarse-grid selection, in
   particular, is fundamentally, sequential in nature.
   We have previously introduced a parallel algorithm {[}A.J. Cleary, R.D.
   Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones, in: Proceedings of the Fifth
   International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in
   Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] for the selection of coarse-grid
   points, based on modifications of certain parallel independent set
   algorithms and the application of heuristics designed to insure the
   quality of the coarse grids, and shown results from a prototype serial
   version of the algorithm.
   In this paper we describe an implementation of a parallel ANIG code,
   using the algorithm of A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E.
   Jones {[}in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving
   Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998]
   as well as other approaches to parallelizing the coarse-grid selection.
   We consider three basic coarsening schemes and certain modifications to
   the basic schemes, designed to address specific performance issues. We
   present numerical results for a broad range of problem sizes and
   descriptions, and draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of the method.
   Finally, we indicate the current directions of the research. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development,
   integration, and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries
   within an object-oriented framework for the solution of large-scale,
   complex multiphysics engineering and scientific problems. Trilinos
   addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these
   problems: (i) providing a streamlined process and set of tools for
   development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting
   interoperability of independently developed software.
   Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections
   of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by
   a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as
   algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist
   underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common
   look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and
   bug-tracking.
   Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of
   abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the
   services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these
   services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages
   can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss
   how Trilinos facilitates high-quality software engineering practices
   that are increasingly required from simulation software.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, concluding the trilogy, develops schemes for the stable
   solution of wave-dominated unsteady problems in general
   three-dimensional domains. The schemes utilize a spectral approximation
   in each subdomain and asymptotic stability of the semidiscrete schemes
   is established. The complex computational domains are constructed by
   using nonoverlapping quadrilaterals in the two-dimensional case and
   hexahedrals in the three-dimensional space.
   To illustrate the ideas underlying the multidomain method, a stable
   scheme for the solution of the three-dimensional linear
   advection-diffusion equation in general curvilinear coordinates is
   developed. The analysis suggests a novel, yet simple, stable treatment
   of geometric singularities like edges and vertices. The theoretical
   results are supported by a two-dimensional implementation of the scheme.
   The main part of the paper is devoted to the development of a spectral
   multidomain scheme for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on
   conservation form and a unified approach for dealing with the open
   boundaries and subdomain boundaries is presented. Well posedness and
   asymptotic stability of the semidiscrete scheme is established in a
   general curvilinear volume, with special attention given to a hexahedral
   domain. The treatment includes a stable procedure for dealing with
   boundary conditions at a solid wall.
   The efficacy of the scheme for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations
   is illustrated by obtaining solutions to subsonic and supersonic
   boundary layer flows with various types of boundary conditions. The
   results are found to agree with the solution of the compressible
   boundary layer equations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a convergent high-order accurate scheme for the solution of
   linear conservation laws in geometrically complex domains. As our main
   example we include a detailed development and analysis of a scheme for
   the time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations in a three-dimensional
   domain. The fully unstructured spatial discretization is made possible
   by the use of a high-order nodal basis, employing multivariate Lagrange
   polynomials defined on the triangles and tetrahedra, while the equations
   themselves are satisfied in a discontinuous Galerkin form with the
   boundary conditions being enforced weakly through a penalty term.
   Accuracy, stability, and convergence of the semidiscrete approximation
   to Maxwell's equations is established rigorously and bounds on the
   growth of the global divergence error are provided. Concerns related to
   efficient implementations are discussed in detail. This sets the stage
   for the presentation of examples, verifying the theoretical results, and
   illustrating the versatility, flexibility, and robustness when solving
   two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems in computational
   electromagnetics. Pure scattering as well as penetration is discussed

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction
   System (COAMPS) has been developed by the Naval Research Laboratory.
   COAMPS consists of an atmospheric data assimilation system comprising
   data quality control, analysis, initialization, and nonhydrostatic
   forecast model components, as well as a hydrostatic ocean model. The
   models can be integrated simultaneously so that the surface fluxes of
   heat, momentum, and moisture are exchanged across the air-water
   interface every time step. Optionally, either the atmospheric or ocean
   model can be used as a stand-alone system.
   The atmospheric component of COAMPS was used for operational support
   for the America(3) team in the 1995 America's Cup races. Results of
   these forecasts indicated the necessity of data assimilation to reduce
   model spinup in the first 6 h of the forecast. Accurate forecasts of
   the low-level wind in the coastal race area was accomplished by
   utilizing triply nested grids to attain the necessary high resolution
   to resolve the local wind patterns and the underlying surface terrain
   field. Two idealized simulations of a tropical cyclone were performed
   with COAMPS. In the first simulation, only the atmospheric model was
   used, assuming a fixed sea surface temperature (SST). A realistic
   structure developed with spiral bands of convection present outside the
   inner eyewall. These spiral bands occasionally contracted inward
   resulting in rapid fluctuations in the intensity of the tropical
   cyclone. In the second simulation, the ocean model was run
   simultaneously with the atmospheric model. The SST cooled over 8
   degrees C over a small area within the radius of maximum winds,
   resulting in a much weaker system. However, there appeared to be little
   effect on the overall strength of the system, as measured by the
   tangential velocities outside the radius of maximum winds.}},

Journal = {{Mathematics of Computation}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{206}},
Pages = {{497-530}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to give a qualitative and quantitative description
   of the numerical error introduced by using finite difference schemes in
   nonconservative form for scalar conservation laws. We show that these
   schemes converge strongly in L(loc)1 norm to the solution of an
   inhomogeneous conservation law containing a Borel measure source term.
   Moreover, we analyze the properties of this Borel measure, and derive a
   sharp estimate for the L1 error between the limit function given by the
   scheme and the correct solution. In general, the measure source term is
   of the order of the entropy dissipation measure associated with the
   scheme. In certain cases, the error can be small for short times, which
   makes it difficult to detect numerically. But generically, such an error
   will grow in time, and this would lead to a large error for large-time
   calculations. Finally, we show that a local correction of any high-order
   accurate scheme in nonconservative form is sufficient to ensure its
   convergence to the correct solution.}},

Abstract = {{The nonhydrostatic Meso model developed at NCEP (Janjic et al, 2001) is
   based on a new approach. Namely, a hydrostatic NWP model using mass
   based vertical coordinate has been extended to include the
   nonhydrostatic motions. In this way favorable features of the
   hydrostatic formulation have been preserved. This procedure did not
   require any linearization or approximation.
   The nonhydrostatic dynamics has been introduced through an add-on
   module. The nonhydrostatic module can be turned on and off, so that
   easy comparison can be made of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic solutions.
   Here, the basic philosophy behind the discretization methods applied in
   the model, and not covered by Janjic et al (2001), is discussed, and
   the latest developments are reviewed. The forecast examples shown
   indicate that significant differences between hydrostatic and
   nonhydrostatic forecasts may develop even at relatively coarse
   resolution of 8 km. Possible future developments are considered.}},

   to reduce the projection errors and to minimize the cost associated with

	the effect of erroneous numerical boundary layers induced by splitting

	explicit/implicit time-intgration rules. These schemes exhibit much
	broader stability regions as compared to Adams-family schemes, typically

	that remain stable at relatively large CFL number. The new schemes
	are implemented within the framework of spectral element discretizations
	in space so that flexibility and accuracy is guaranteed in the numerical
	experimentation. A model Stokes problem is studied in detail, and
	several examples of Navier-Stokes solutions of flows in complex geometries

Abstract = {{This paper describes a unified, element based Galerkin (EBG) framework
   for a three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic model for the atmosphere. In
   general, EBG methods possess high-order accuracy, geometric flexibility,
   excellent dispersion properties and good scalability. Our nonhydrostatic
   model, based on the compressible Euler equations, is appropriate for
   both limited-area and global atmospheric simulations. Both a continuous
   Galerkin (CG), or spectral element, and discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
   model are considered using hexahedral elements. The formulation is
   suitable for both global and limited-area atmospheric modeling, although
   we restrict our attention to 3D limited-area phenomena in this study;
   global atmospheric simulations will be presented in a follow-up paper.
   Domain decomposition and communication algorithms used by both our CG
   and DG models are presented. The communication volume and exchange
   algorithms for CG and DG are compared and contrasted. Numerical
   verification of the model was performed using two test cases: flow past
   a 3D mountain and buoyant convection of a bubble in a neutral
   atmosphere; these tests indicate that both CG and DG can simulate the
   necessary physics of dry atmospheric dynamics. Scalability of both
   methods is shown up to 8192 CPU cores, with near ideal scaling for DG up
   to 32,768 cores. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   graphics processing units (GPU) provide architectures and new programing
   models that enable to harness their large processing power and to design
   computational fluid dynamics simulations at both high performance and
   low cost. We report on solving the 2D compressible Euler equations on
   modern Graphics Processing Units (GPU) with high-resolution methods,
   i.e. able to handle complex situations involving shocks and
   discontinuities. We implement two different second order numerical
   schemes, a Godunov-based scheme with quasi-exact Riemann solver and a
   fully discrete second-order central scheme as originally proposed by
   Kurganov and Tadmor. Performance measurements show that these two
   numerical schemes can achieves x30 to x70 speed-up on recent GPU
   hardware compared to a mono-thread CPU reference implementation. These
   first results provide very promising perpectives for designing a
   GPU-based software framework for applications in computational

Title = {{A sensitivity study of the Kelvin wave and the Madden-Julian Oscillation

Abstract = {{The dynamical core of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Spectral
   Element Atmospheric Model (NSEAM) is coupled with full physics and used
   to investigate the organization and propagation of equatorial
   atmospheric waves under the aquaplanet conditions. The sensitivity of
   the model simulation to the amount of horizontal viscosity, distribution
   of the vertical levels, and selected details of the precipitation
   physics is examined and discussed mainly utilizing simulated convective
   precipitation with the aid of time-longitude plots and the spectral
   diagrams designed by Wheeler and Kiladis (1999). It is shown that the
   simulation of the Kelvin wave and Madden-Julian Oscillation depends
   strongly on the details of the vertical level distribution and the
   choice of parameters in the convective parameterization. Efforts are
   made to calibrate the new model to capture the essential interaction
   between the dynamics and physics of the atmosphere. The speed and
   spectrum of the eastward propagating Kelvin waves and the signature of
   the Madden-Julian Oscillation simulated by the new model reveal main
   features similar to those predicted by the simplified theory and found
   in limited observations. This study attempts to understand the
   significant variability found among the aquaplanet simulations by
   various global atmospheric models and highlights the uncertainties
   concerning convective processes and their coupling to large-scale wave
   motion in large-scale models of the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Ogura and Phillips derived the original anelastic model through
   systematic formal asymptotics using the flow Mach number as the
   expansion parameter. To arrive at a reduced model that would
   simultaneously represent internal gravity waves and the effects of
   advection on the same time scale, they had to adopt a distinguished
   limit requiring that the dimensionless stability of the background state
   be on the order of the Mach number squared. For typical flow Mach
   numbers of M; similar to 1/30, this amounts to total variations of
   potential temperature across the troposphere of less than one Kelvin
   (i.e., to unrealistically weak stratification). Various generalizations
   of the original anelastic model have been proposed to remedy this issue.
   Later, Durran proposed the pseudoincompressible model following the same
   goals, but via a somewhat different route of argumentation. The present
   paper provides a scale analysis showing that the regime of validity of
   two of these extended models covers stratification strengths on the
   order of (h(sc)/theta)d theta/dz, M(2/3), which corresponds to realistic
   variations of potential temperature theta across the pressure scale
   height h(sc) of Delta theta vertical bar(hsc)(0) < 30K.
   Specifically, it is shown that (i) for (h(sc)/theta)d theta/dz < M(mu)
   with 0 < mu < 2, the atmosphere features three asymptotically distinct
   time scales, namely, those of advection, internal gravity waves, and
   sound waves; (ii) within this range of stratifications, the structures
   and frequencies of the linearized internal wave modes of the
   compressible, anelastic, and pseudoincompressible models agree up to the
   order of M(mu); and (iii) if mu < 2/3, the accumulated phase differences
   of internal waves remain asymptotically small even over the long
   advective time scale. The argument is completed by observing that the
   three models agree with respect to the advective nonlinearities and that
   all other nonlinear terms are of higher order in M.}},

Abstract = {{Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the numerical solution of
   partial differential equations have enjoyed considerable success because
   they are both flexible and robust: They allow arbitrary unstructured
   geometries and easy control of accuracy without compromising simulation
   stability. Lately, another property of DG has been growing in
   importance: The majority of a DG operator is applied in an element-local
   way, with weak penalty-based element-to-element coupling.
   The resulting locality in memory access is one of the factors that
   enables DG to run on off-the-shelf, massively parallel graphics
   processors (GPUs). In addition, DG's high-order nature lets it require
   fewer data points per represented wavelength and hence fewer memory
   accesses, in exchange for higher arithmetic intensity. Both of these
   factors work significantly in favor of a GPU implementation of DG.
   Using a single US\$400 Nvidia GTX 280 GPU, we accelerate a solver for
   Maxwell's equations on a general 3D unstructured grid by a factor of
   around 50 relative to a serial computation on a current-generation CPU.
   In many cases, our algorithms exhibit full use of the device's available
   memory bandwidth. Example computations achieve and surpass 200
   gigaflops/s of net application-level floating point work.
   In this article, we describe and derive the techniques used to reach
   this level of performance. In addition, we present comprehensive data on
   the accuracy and runtime behavior of the method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations
   of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of
   nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton
   correction equations. The link between the two methods is the
   Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without
   forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety
   of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be
   required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with
   Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK
   method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning.
   JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by
   nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential
   equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other
   nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs)
   and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an over-view of the
   mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of
   preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be
   wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method
   (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant
   code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution
   of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for
   all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a
   perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest
   and to provide sources of further practical information. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The resolutions of interests in atmospheric simulations require
   prohibitively large computational resources. Adaptive mesh refinement
   (AMR) tries to mitigate this problem by putting high resolution in
   crucial areas of the domain. We investigate the performance of a
   tree-based AMR algorithm for the high order discontinuous Galerkin
   method on quadrilateral grids with non-conforming elements. We perform a
   detailed analysis of the cost of AMR by comparing this to uniform
   reference simulations of two standard atmospheric test cases: density
   current and rising thermal bubble. The analysis shows up to 15 times
   speed-up of the AMR simulations with the cost of mesh adaptation below
   1\% of the total runtime. We pay particular attention to the
   implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration methods and show that the ARK2
   method is more robust with respect to dynamically adapting meshes than
   BDF2. Preliminary analysis of preconditioning reveals that it can be an
   important factor in the AMR overhead. The compiler optimizations provide
   significant runtime reduction and positively affect the effectiveness of
   AMR allowing for speed-ups greater than it would follow from the simple
   performance model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   similar to the DG method. Both methods conserve to machine precision,

   very long simulation times. We addressed this issue by using filters

To allow for local refinement of the polynomial order or subdomain subdivision, non-conforming subdomains are treated by a mortar method. Spectral accuracy is shown in one- and two-dimensional linear and non-linear problems. Application is made to four compressible flow problems: the Couette flow, a steady boundary layer over a flat plate, steady transonic flow in a nozzle, and unsteady flow over a cylinder at a Reynolds number of 75.

   approximating Maxwell's equations in the time-domain with a high-order
   quadrilateral discontinuous spectral element method (DSEM). The method
   is a collocation form of the discontinuous Galerkin method for
   hyperbolic systems where the solution is approximated by a tensor
   product Legendre expansion and inner products are replaced with
   Gauss-Legendre quadratures. To increase flexibility of the method, we
   use a mortar element method to couple element faces. Mortars provide a
   means for coupling element faces along which the polynomial orders
   differ, which allows the flexibility to choose the approximation order
   within an element by considering only local resolution requirements.
   Mortars also permit local subdivision of a mesh by connecting element
   faces that do not share a full side. We present evidence showing that
   the convergence of the non-conforming approximations is spectral along
   with examples of their use. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A global model of the atmosphere is presented governed by the shallow
   water equations and discretized by a Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin
   method on an unstructured triangular grid. The shallow water equations
   on the sphere, a two-dimensional surface in R-3, are locally
   represented in terms of spherical triangular coordinates, the
   appropriate local coordinate mappings on triangles. On every triangular
   grid element, this leads to a two-dimensional representation of
   tangential momentum and therefore only two discrete momentum equations.
   The discontinuous Galerkin method consists of an integral formulation
   which requires both area (elements) and line (element faces) integrals.
   Here, we use a Rusanov numerical flux to resolve the discontinuous
   fluxes at the element faces. A strong stability-preserving third-order
   Runge-Kutta method is applied for the time discretization. The
   polynomial space of order k on each curved triangle of the grid is
   characterized by a Lagrange basis and requires high-order quadature
   rules for the integration over elements and element faces. For the
   presented method no mass matrix inversion is necessary, except in a
   preprocessing step.
   The validation of the atmospheric model has been done considering
   standard tests from Williamson et al. {[}D.L.Williamson,J.B. Drake,J.J.
   Hack, R.Jakob, P.N. Swarztrauber, A standard test set for numerical
   approximations to the shallow water equations in spherical geometry, J.
   Comput. Phys. 102 (1992)211-224], unsteady analytical solutions of the
   nonlinear shallow water equations and a barotropic instability caused
   by an initial perturbation of a jet stream. A convergence rate of
   O(Delta chi(k+1)) was observed in the model experiments. Furthermore, a
   numerical experiment is presented, for which the third-order
   time-integration method lim- its the model error. Thus, the time step
   Delta t is restricted by both the CFL-condition and accuracy demands.
   Conservation of mass was shown up to machine precision and energy
   conservation converges for both increasing grid resolution and
   increasing polynomial order k. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   understood in the sense of Volpert {[}Vo] or, more generally, in the one
   proposed by Dal Maso-Le Floch-Murat {[}DLM]. Assuming that each
   characteristic field of the system is either genuinely nonlinear or
   linearly degenerate and the total variation of the initial data is
   sufficiently small, we prove the convergence of the random-choice method
   (introduced by Glimm in the context of systems of conservation laws).
   Our proof is based on the result of pointwise convergence due to the
   second author {[}Li3]. Our result proves the existence of entropy weak

Abstract = {{A spectral element (SE) implementation of the Givoli-Neta non-reflecting
   boundary condition (NRBC) is considered for the solution of the
   Klein-Gordon equation. The infinite domain is truncated via an
   artificial boundary B, and a high-order NRBC is applied on B. Numerical
   examples, in various configurations, concerning the propagation of a
   pressure pulse are used to demonstrate the performance of the SE
   implementation. Effects of time integration techniques and long term
   results are discussed. Specifically, we show that in order to achieve
   the full benefits of high-order accuracy requires balancing all errors
   involved: this includes the order of accuracy of the spatial
   discretization method, time-integrators, and boundary conditions.

Abstract = {{A new, high-order, conservative, and efficient method for conservation
   laws on unstructured grids is developed. It combines the best features
   of structured and unstructured grid methods to attain computational
   efficiency and geometric flexibility; it utilizes the concept of
   discontinuous and high-order local representations to achieve
   conservation and high accuracy; and it is based on the finite-difference
   formulation for simplicity. Universal reconstructions are obtained by
   distributing unknown and flux points in a geometrically similar manner
   for all unstructured cells. Placements of these points with various
   orders of accuracy are given for the triangular elements. Accuracy
   studies of the method are carried out with the two-dimensional linear
   wave equation and Burgers' equation, and each order of accuracy is
   verified numerically. Numerical solutions of plane electromagnetic waves
   incident on perfectly conducting circular cylinders are presented and
   compared with the exact solutions to demonstrate the capability of the
   method. Excellent agreement has been found. The method is much simpler
   than the discontinuous Galerkin and spectral volume methods for

Abstract = {{An adaptive finite element scheme for transient problems is presented.
   The classic h-enrichment/coarsening is employed in conjunction with a
   tetrahedral finite element discretization in three dimensions. A mesh
   change is performed every n time steps, depending on the Courant number
   employed and the number of `protective layers' added ahead of the
   refined region. In order to simplify the refinement/coarsening logic and
   to be as fast as possible, only one level of refinement/coarsening is
   allowed per mesh change. A high degree of vectorizability has been
   achieved by pre-sorting the elements and then performing the
   refinement/coarsening groupwise according to the case at hand. Further
   reductions in CPU requirements are realized by optimizing the
   identification and sorting of elements for refinement and deletion. The
   developed technology has been used extensively for shock-shock and
   shock-object interaction runs in a production mode. A typical example of
   this class of problems is given.}},

Abstract = {{An automated approach to quadrilateral mesh generation with complex
   internal geometric feature constraints is presented in this paper. It
   can deal with all kinds of feature constraints such as internal holes,
   constraint lines, constraint points, density lines and density points,
   etc., and satisfy special requirements of mesh generation for numerical
   analysis. The quadrilateral mesh is generated based on the looping
   algorithm. As the core of the algorithm, the new splitting criteria are
   put forward to improve the quality and efficiency of mesh generation.
   The method of dealing with feature constraints is proposed by
   considering constraint lines and points, density lines and density
   points as internal holes with zero area. The method for generating
   boundary elements is also introduced to improve the element quality
   around the boundary and feature constraints. For the situation in which
   feature constraints subdivide the domain into sub-domains, an automatic
   determination method of sub-domain boundaries is presented. An improved
   looping algorithm is presented for 3D surface meshing with feature
   constraints. The determination of proper splitting plane and the
   handling of feature constraints are put forward. The program of
   quadrilateral mesh generation has been developed based on the method
   presented in this paper and successfully applied to mesh generation in
   several engineering fields.}},

Abstract = {{One major issue in the accurate solution of advection-dominated problems
   by means of high-order methods is the ability of the solver to maintain
   monotonicity. This problem is critical for spectral elements, where
   Gibbs oscillations may pollute the solution. However, typical
   filter-based stabilization techniques used with spectral elements are
   not monotone. In this paper, residual-based stabilization methods
   originally derived for finite elements are constructed and applied to
   high-order spectral elements. In particular, we show that the use of the
   variational multiscale (VMS) method greatly improves the solution of the
   transport-diffusion equation by reducing over-and under-shoots, and can
   be therefore considered an alternative to filter-based schemes. We also
   combine these methods with discontinuity capturing schemes (DC) to
   suppress oscillations that may occur in proximity of boundaries or
   internal layers. Additional improvement in the solution is also obtained
   when a method that we call FOS (for First-Order Subcells) is used in
   combination with VMS and DC. In the regions where discontinuities occur,
   FOS subdivides a spectral element of order p into p(2) subcells and then
   uses 1st-order basis functions and integration rules on every subcell of
   the element. The algorithms are assessed with the solution of classical
   steady and transient 1D, 2D, and pseudo-3D problems using spectral
   elements up to order 16. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We test the behaviour of a unified continuous/discontinuous Galerkin
   (CG/DG) shallow-water model in spherical geometry with curved elements
   on three different grids of ubiquitous use in atmospheric modelling: (i)
   the cubed-sphere, (ii) the reduced latitude-longitude, and (iii) the
   icosahedral grid. Both conforming and non-conforming grids are adopted
   including static and dynamically adaptive grids for a total of twelve
   mesh configurations. The behaviour of CG and DG on the different grids
   are compared for a nonlinear midlatitude perturbed jet and for a linear
   case that admits an analytic solution. Because the inviscid solution on
   certain grids shows a high sensitivity to the resolution, the viscous
   counterpart of the governing equations is also solved and the results
   compared. The logically unstructured element-based CG/DG model described
   in this article is flexible with respect to arbitrary grids. However, we
   were unable to define a best grid configuration that could possibly

Abstract = {{The stabilization of high order spectral elements to solve the transport
   equations for tracers in the atmosphere remains an active topic of
   research among atmospheric modelers. This paper builds on our previous
   work on variational multiscale stabilization (VMS) and discontinuity
   capturing (DC) (Marras et al. (2012) {[}7]) and shows the applicability
   of VMS+DC to realistic atmospheric problems that involve physics
   coupling with phase change in the simulation of 3D deep convection. We
   show that the VMS+DC approach is a robust technique that can damp the
   high order modes characterizing the spectral element solution of complex
   coupled transport problems. The method has important properties that
   techniques of more common use often lack: 1) it is free of a
   user-defined parameter, 2) it is anisotropic in that it only acts along
   the flow direction, 3) it is numerically consistent, and 4) it can
   improve the monotonicity of high-order spectral elements. The proposed
   method is assessed by comparing the results against those obtained with
   a fourth-order hyper-viscosity programmed in the same code. The main
   conclusion that arises is that tuning can be fully avoided without loss
   of accuracy if the dissipative scheme is properly designed. Finally, the
   cost of parallel communication is that of a second order operator which
   means that fewer communications are required by VMS+DC than by a
   hyper-viscosity method; fewer communications translate into a faster and
   more scalable code, which is of vital importance as we approach the
   exascale range of computing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The high order spectral element approximation of the Euler equations is
   stabilized via a dynamic sub-grid scale model (Dyn-SGS). This model was
   originally designed for linear finite elements to solve compressible
   flows at large Mach numbers. We extend its application to high-order
   spectral elements to solve the Euler equations of low Mach number
   stratified flows. The major justification of this work is twofold:
   stabilization and large eddy simulation are achieved via one scheme
   only.
   Because the diffusion coefficients of the regularization stresses
   obtained via Dyn-SGS are residual-based, the effect of the artificial
   diffusion is minimal in the regions where the solution is smooth. The
   direct consequence is that the nominal convergence rate of the
   high-order solution of smooth problems is not degraded. To our
   knowledge, this is the first application in atmospheric modeling of a
   spectral element model stabilized by an eddy viscosity scheme that, by
   construction, may fulfill stabilization requirements, can model
   turbulence via LES, and is completely free of a user-tunable parameter.
   From its derivation, it will be immediately clear that Dyn-SGS is
   independent of the numerical method; it could be implemented in a
   discontinuous Galerkin, finite volume, or other environments alike.
   Preliminary discontinuous Galerkin results are reported as well. The
   straightforward extension to non-linear scalar problems is also
   described. A suite of 1D, 2D, and 3D test cases is used to assess the
   method, with some comparison against the results obtained with the most
   known Lilly-Smagorinsky SGS model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Weather and climate prediction software has enjoyed the benefits of
   exponentially increasing processor power for almost 50 years. Even with
   the advent of large-scale parallelism in weather models, much of the
   performance increase has come from increasing processor speed rather
   than increased parallelism. This free ride is nearly over. Recent
   results also indicate that simply increasing the use of large-scale
   parallelism will prove ineffective for many scenarios. We present an
   alternative method of scaling model performance by exploiting emerging
   architectures using the fine-grain parallelism once used in vector
   machines. The paper shows the promise of this approach by demonstrating
   a 20 x speedup for a computationally intensive portion of the Weather
   Research and Forecast (WRF) model on an NVIDIA 8800 GTX Graphics
   Processing Unit (GPU). We expect an overall 1.3x speedup from this
   change alone.}},

Title = {{Performance of the HOMME dynamical core in the aqua-planet configuration
   of NCAR CAM4: equatorial waves}},
Journal = {{Annales Geophysicae}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{221-227}},
Abstract = {{A new atmospheric dynamical core, named the High Order Method Modeling
   Environment (HOMME), has been recently included in the NCAR-Community
   Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). It is a petascale capable
   high-order element-based conservative dynamical core developed on a
   cubed-sphere grid. We have examined the model simulations with HOMME
   using the aqua-planet mode of CAM4 (atmospheric component of CCSM4) and
   evaluated its performance in simulating the equatorial waves, considered
   a crucial element of climate variability. For this we compared the
   results with two other established models in CAM4 framework, which are
   the finite-volume (FV) and Eulerian spectral (EUL) dynamical cores.
   Although the gross features seem to be comparable, important differences
   have been found among the three dynamical cores. The phase speed of
   Kelvin waves in HOMME is faster and more satisfactory than those in FV
   and EUL. The higher phase speed is attributed to an increased
   large-scale precipitation in the upper troposphere and a more top-heavy
   heating structure. The variance of the n = 1 equatorial Rossby waves is
   underestimated by all three of them, but comparatively HOMME simulations
   are more reasonable. For the n = 0 eastward inertio-gravity waves, the
   variances are weak and phase speeds are too slow, scaled to shallow
   equivalent depths. However, the variance in HOMME is relatively more
   compared to the two other dynamical cores. The mixed Rossby-gravity
   waves are feeble in all the three cases. In summary, model simulations
   using HOMME are reasonably good, with some improvement relative to FV
   and EUL in capturing some of the important characteristics associated
   with equatorial waves.}},

Journal = {{progress in Electromagnetics Research-Pier}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{671-692}},
Abstract = {{Mass-lumped continuous finite elements allow for explicit time stepping
   with the second-order wave equation if the resulting integration weights
   are positive and provide sufficient accuracy. To meet these requirements
   on triangular and tetrahedral meshes, the construction of continuous
   finite elements for a given polynomial degree on the edges involves
   polynomials of higher degree in the interior. The parameters describing
   the supporting nodes of the Lagrange interpolating polynomials and the
   integration weights are the unknowns of a polynomial system of
   equations, which is linear in the integration weights. To find candidate
   sets for the nodes, it is usually required that the number of equations
   equals the number of unknowns, although this may be neither necessary
   nor sufficient. Here, this condition is relaxed by requiring that the
   number of equations does not exceed the number of unknowns. This
   resulted in two new types elements of degree 6 for symmetrically placed
   nodes. Unfortunately, the first type is not unisolvent. There are many
   different elements of the second type with a large range in their
   associated time-stepping stability limit. To assess the efficiency of
   the elements of various degrees, numerical tests on a simple problem
   with an exact solution were performed. Efficiency was measured by the
   computational time required to obtain a solution at a given accuracy.
   For the chosen example, elements of degree 4 with fourth-order time
   stepping appear to be the most efficient.}},

Title = {{Comparison between adaptive and uniform discontinuous Galerkin
   simulations in dry 2D bubble experiments}},
Journal = {{Journal of Computational Physics}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{235}},
Pages = {{371-393}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive mesh refinement generally aims to increase computational
   efficiency without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solution.
   However it is an open question in which regions the spatial resolution
   can actually be coarsened without affecting the accuracy of the result.
   This question is investigated for a specific example of dry atmospheric
   convection, namely the simulation of warm air bubbles. For this purpose
   a novel numerical model is developed that is tailored towards this
   specific application. The compressible Euler equations are solved with a
   discontinuous Galerkin method. Time integration is done with an
   IMEX-method and the dynamic grid adaptivity uses space filling curves
   via the AMATOS function library. So far the model is able to simulate
   dry flow in two-dimensional geometry without subgrid-scale modeling. The
   model is tested with three standard test cases.
   An error indicator is introduced for a warm air bubble test case which
   allows one to compare the accuracy between different choices of
   refinement regions without knowing the exact solution. Essentially this
   is done by comparing features of the solution that are strongly
   sensitive to spatial resolution. For the rising warm air bubble the
   additional error by using adaptivity is smaller than 1\% of the total
   numerical error if the average number of elements used for the adaptive
   simulation is about a factor of two times smaller than the number used
   for the simulation with the uniform fine-resolution grid.
   Correspondingly the adaptive simulation is almost two times faster than
   the uniform simulation. Furthermore the adaptive simulation is more
   accurate than a uniform simulation when both use the same CPU-time. (C)

  abstract = {A discontinuous Galerkin shallow water model on the cubed sphere is
	developed, thereby extending the transport scheme developed by Nair
	et al. The continuous flux form nonlinear shallow water equations
	in curvilinear coordinates are employed. The spatial discretization
	employs a modal basis set consisting of Legendre polynomials. Fluxes
	along the element boundaries (internal interfaces) are approximated
	by a Lax–Friedrichs scheme. A third-order total variation diminishing
	Runge–Kutta scheme is applied for time integration, without any
	filter or limiter. Numerical results are reported for the standard
	shallow water test suite. The numerical solutions are very accurate,
	there are no spurious oscillations in test case 5, and the model
	conserves mass to machine precision. Although the scheme does not
	formally conserve global invariants such as total energy and potential
	enstrophy, conservation of these quantities is better preserved than
	in existing finite-volume models. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright

Abstract = {{A new atmospheric general circulation model (dynamical core) based on
   the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is developed. This model is
   conservative, high-order accurate and has been integrated into the
   NCAR's high-order method modeling environment (HOMME) to leverage
   scalable parallel computing capability to thousands of processors. The
   computational domain for this 3-D hydrostatic model is a cubed-sphere
   with curvilinear coordinates; the governing equations are cast in
   flux-form. The horizontal DG discretization employs a high-order nodal
   basis set of orthogonal Lagrange-Legendre polynomials and fluxes of
   inter-element boundaries are approximated with Lax-Friedrichs numerical
   flux. The vertical discretization follows the 1-D vertical Lagrangian
   coordinates approach combined with the cell-integrated semi-Lagrangian
   conservative remapping procedure. Time integration follows the
   third-order strong stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme. The
   domain decomposition is applied through space-filling curve approach. To
   validate the 3-D DG model in HOMME framework, a baroclinic instability
   test is used and the results are compared with those from the
   established models. Parallel performance is evaluated on IBM Blue Gene/L
   Supercomputers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of three anelastic systems (Ogura and Phillips; Wilhelmson
   and Ogura; Lipps and Hemler) and the pseudo-incompressible system is
   investigated for small-amplitude and finite-amplitude disturbances.
   Based on analytic Solutions to the linearized, hydrostatic mountain wave
   problem, the accuracy of the Lipps and Hemler and pseudo-incompressible
   systems is distinctly superior to that of the other two-systems. The
   linear dispersion relations indicate the accuracy of the
   pseudo-incompressible system should improve and the accuracy of the
   Lipps and Hemler system should decrease as the waves become more
   nonhydrostatic.
   Since analytic solutions are not available for finite-amplitude
   disturbances, five nonlinear, nonhydrostatic numerical models based on
   these four systems and the complete compressible equations are
   constructed to determine the ability of each `'sound proof'' system to
   describe finite-amplitude disturbances. A comparison between the
   analytic solutions and numerical simulations of the linear mountain wave
   problem indicate the overall quality of the simulations is good, but the
   numerical errors are significantly larger than those associated, with
   the pseudo-incompressible and Lipps and Hemler approximations. Numerical
   simulations of flow past a steady finite-amplitude heat source for an
   isothermal atmosphere and an atmosphere with an elevated inversion
   indicate the Lipps and Hemler and pseudo-incompressible systems also
   produce the most accurate approximations to the compressible solutions
   for finite-amplitude disturbances.}},

   related to the wire basket of the elements. As in the scalar case, the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new method for adaptive all-quadrilateral
   mesh generation for two-dimensional domains, including domains modeled
   by constraints with complex geometry or with varying scales. The method
   subdivides the domain's bounding box using a new extended quadtree
   scheme. In this subdivision process, the quadtree node corners are moved
   onto the geometrical constraints using local deformation criteria during
   the tree refinement steps. We define new subdivision patterns as part of
   our extended quadtree to add flexibility in the adaptation and guarantee
   that geometrical constraints are entirely modeled by tree edges. During
   the process, we ensure grid alignment with constraint accuracy and
   element quality at every scale. Our proposal converts the tree structure
   into a mesh with only quadrilateral elements. Results showed that our
   method generates elements of reasonable quality even for complex
   geometries and varying scales. The small number of parameters
   controlling the process is intuitive and makes our method efficient and
   user friendly.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive mesh projection method for the time-dependent incompressible
   Euler equations is presented. The domain is spatially discretised using
   quad/octrees and a multilevel Poisson solver is used to obtain the
   pressure. Complex solid boundaries are represented using a
   volume-of-fluid approach. Second-order convergence in space and time is
   demonstrated on regular, statically and dynamically refined grids. The
   quad/octree discretisation proves to be very flexible and allows
   accurate and efficient tracking of flow features. The source code of the
   method implementation is freely available. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Title = {{An efficient physics-based preconditioner for the fully implicit

Journal = {{Journal of Computational Physics}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{189}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In atmospheric flow situations typical of a small-scale atmospheric
   thermal, a separation of time scales exists between the fast sound wave
   time scale and the advective time scale. Atmospheric models have been
   designed to take advantage of this disparity of time scales with
   numerical approaches such as the semi-implicit or split-explicit
   approach being used to efficiently step over the fast sound waves. Some
   of these numerical approaches are first order in time. To improve
   accuracy over these methods, a fully implicit and nonlinearly consistent
   (INC) flow solver has beer] developed for the Navier-Stokes equation
   set. In our INC method, the equation set is solved by use of the
   Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method. An efficient preconditioner
   has been developed which uses the semi-implicit method to solve the
   governing equations. Being that this preconditioner was designed to
   attack the fastest waves in the system and not other features in the
   implicit system such as advection or turbulent diffusion, the
   preconditioning technique is labeled as a physics-based preconditioner.
   A variety of linear solvers including SSOR, Krylov methods and/or
   multigrid approaches are used to approximately invert the pressure
   matrix in the semi-implicit algorithm. A suite of simulations will be
   conducted utilizing different linear solvers for the simple problem of
   the bouyant rise of a warm bubble. The problem will also document the
   ability of the INC approach to achieve second order in time accuracy.

	abstract = {A discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element formulation is proposed for the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a vertically stratified fluid, which are of interest in mesoscale nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling. The resulting scheme naturally ensures conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. A semi-implicit time-integration approach is adopted to improve the efficiency of the scheme with respect to the explicit Runge-Kutta time integration strategies usually employed in the context of DG formulations. A method is also presented to reformulate the resulting linear system as a pseudo-Helmholtz problem. In doing this, we obtain a DG discretization closely related to those proposed for the solution of elliptic problems, and we show how to take advantage of the numerical integration rules (required in all DG methods for the area and flux integrals) to increase the efficiency of the solution algorithm. The resulting numerical formulation is then validated on a collection of classical two-dimensional test cases, including density driven flows and mountain wave simulations. The performance analysis shows that the semi-implicit method is, indeed, superior to explicit methods and that the pseudo-Helmholtz formulation yields further efficiency improvements.

  abstract = {In this article the implementation of the semi-Lagrangian method in
	a high-resolution version of the ECMWF forecast model is examined.
	Novel aspects include the application of the semi-Lagrangian scheme
	to a global model using the ECMWF hybrid coordinate in the vertical
	and its use in a baroclinic spectral model in conjunction with a
	reduced Gaussian grid in the horizontal. The former Eulerian vorticity-divergence
	formulation is first converted into a momentum-equation formulation
	that is considerably more economical, thanks in part to the incorporation
	of Legendre transform efficiencies that were previously demonstrated
	for the shallow-water equations. The semi-Lagrangian formulation
	is presented in detail, together with a discussion of computational
	aspects that are relevant for executing the high-resolution model
	efficiently on a modestly parallel supercomputer. The impact of formulation
	changes is assessed via numerical experiments on a set of 12 independent
	cases. In particular it is shown that, by virtue of using a larger
	time step, the semi-Lagrangian version is several times more efficient
	than the Eulerian scheme, that the hybrid-coordinate configuration
	maintains its design advantage over the sigma-coordinate version
	in the stratosphere, that the &#8220;vertically noninterpolating&#8221;
	scheme performs better than the &#8220;fully interpolating&#8221;
	method, and that the increase in horizontal resolution from T106
	to T213 (enabled in part by the gains in model efficiency) has a
	significant positive impact.},

   decomposition of the domain into quadrilateral elements. This
   automatically generates meshes composed entirely by quadrilaterals over
   complex geometries (there is no need for a previous step where triangles
   are generated). A background mesh with the desired element sizes allows
   to obtain the preferred sizes anywhere in the domain. The final mesh can
   be viewed as the optimal one given the objective function is defined.
   The recursive algorithm induces an efficient data structure which

  abstract = {Most numerical weather prediction models rely on a terrain-following
	coordinate framework. The computational mesh is thus characterized
	by inhomogeneities with scales determined by the underlying topography.
	Such inhomogeneities may affect the truncation error of numerical
	schemes. In this study, a new class of terrainfollowing coordinate
	systems for use in atmospheric prediction models is proposed. Unlike
	conventional systems, the new smooth level vertical (SLEVE) coordinate
	yields smooth coordinates at mid- and upper levels. The basic concept
	of the new coordinate is to employ a scale-dependent vertical decay
	of underlying terrain features. The decay rate is selected such that
	small-scale topographic variations decay much faster with height
	than their large-scale counterparts. This generalization implies
	a nonlocal coordinate transformation. The new coordinate is tested
	and compared against standard sigma and hybrid coordinate systems
	using an idealized advection test. It is demonstrated that the presence
	of coordinate transformations induces substantial truncation errors.
	These are critical for grid inhomogeneities with wavelengths smaller
	than approximately eight grid increments, and may overpower the regular-grid
	truncation error of the underlying finite-difference approximation.
	These results are confirmed by a theoretical analysis of the truncation
	error. In addition, the new coordinate is tested in idealized and
	real-case numerical experiments using a nonhydrostatic model. The
	simulations using the new coordinate yield a substantial reduction
	of small-scale noise in dynamical and thermodynamical model fields.

Abstract = {{Nearly 30 years after introducing the first computer model for weather
   forecasting, the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) is developing the 4th
   generation of its numerical weather prediction (NWP) system. It
   consists of a global grid point model (GME) based on a triangular grid
   and a non-hydrostatic Lokal Modell (LM). The operational demand for
   running this new system is immense and can only be met by parallel
   computers. From the experience gained in developing earlier NWP models,
   several new problems had to be taken into account during the design
   phase of the system. Most important were portability (including
   efficiency of the programs on several computer architectures) and ease
   of code maintainability. Also the organization and administration of
   the work done by developers from different teams and institutions is
   more complex than it used to be. The paper describes the models and
   gives some performance results. The modular approach used for the
   design of the LM is explained and the effects on the development are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Main objective of this paper is to outline possible ways how to achieve
   a substantial acceleration in case of advection-diffusion equation
   (A-DE) calculation, which is commonly used for a description of the
   pollutant behavior in atmosphere. A-DE is a kind of partial differential
   equation (PDE) and in general case it is usually solved by numerical
   integration due to its high complexity. These types of calculations are
   time consuming thus the main idea of our work is to adopt CUDA platform
   and commodity GPU card to do the calculations in a faster way. The
   solution is based on method of lines with 4 h order Runge-Kutta scheme
   to handle the integration. As a matter of fact, the selected approach
   involves number of auxiliary variables and thus the memory management is
   critical in order to achieve desired performance. We have implemented
   several possible solutions that use different memory access schemes.
   Detailed evaluation is provided in this paper where the obtained results
   show a tremendous processing speed up in comparison to CPU.}},

	from the reference profile about which the implicitly treated gravity
	wave terms are linearized. The stability criterion is shown in general
	to be much more stringent than might he assumed from a simple analytical
	solution. Instability may occur when there exists a region in which
	the static stability of the actual atmosphere differs significantly
	from that of the reference atmosphere, and for realistic actual profiles
	and commonly chosen reference profiles it is likely to arise at vertical
	resolutions that are little higher than those used in previous tests
	of the scheme. Stabilization is achieved either by an appropriate
	change of reference profile or by a modification of the time-averaging
	of gravity wave terms. Both may result in a small further reduction
	in gravity wave phase speeds. Alternatives are mentioned which give
	better phase speeds at the expense of a reduced time step.},

Abstract = {{Structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) methods for the numerical
   solution of partial differential equations yield highly advantageous
   ratios for cost/accuracy as compared to methods based on static uniform
   approximations. These techniques are being effectively used in many
   domains including computational fluid dynamics, numerical relativity,
   astrophysics, subsurface modeling, and oil reservoir simulation.
   Distributed implementations of these methods, however, lead to
   significant challenges in dynamic data-distribution, load-balancing, and
   runtime management. This paper presents an application-centric
   characterization of a suite of dynamic domain-based inverse
   space-filling curve partitioning techniques for the distributed adaptive
   grid hierarchies that underlie SAMR applications. The overall goal of
   this research is to formulate policies required to drive a dynamically
   adaptive metapartitioner for SAMR grid hierarchies capable of selecting
   the most appropriate partitioning strategy at runtime based on current
   application and system state. Such a metapartitioner can significantly
   reduce the execution time of SAIVIR applications.}},

	different resolutions were computed by the participants of the ?Workshop
	on Numerical Methods for Solving Nonlinear Flow Problems?, which
	was held on 11-13 September 1990 at the National Center for Supercomputing
	Applications (NCSA). In general, it was found that when the flow
	was adequately resolved, all of the numerical schemes produced solutions
	that contained the basic physics as well as most of the flow detail
	of the reference solution. However, when the flow was marginally
	resolved, there were significant differences between the solutions
	produced by the various models. Finally, when the flow was poorly
	resolved, none of the models performed very well. While higher-order
	and spectral-type schemes performed best for adequately and marginally
	resolved flow, solutions made with these schemes were virtually unusable
	for poorly resolved flow. In contrast, the monotonic schemes provided
	the most coherent and smooth solutions for poorly resolved flow,
	however with noticeable amplitude and phase speed errors, even at
	finer resolutions.},

Abstract = {{We present a new algorithm for numerically computing quadrature
   formulas for arbitrary domains which exactly integrate a given
   polynomial space. An effective method for constructing quadrature
   formulas has been to numerically solve a nonlinear set of equations for
   the quadrature points and their associated weights. Symmetry conditions
   are often used to reduce the number of equations and unknowns. Our
   algorithm instead relies on the construction of cardinal functions and
   thus requires that the number of quadrature points N be equal to the
   dimension of a prescribed lower dimensional polynomial space. The
   cardinal functions allow us to treat the quadrature weights as
   dependent variables and remove them, as well as an equivalent number of
   equations, from the numerical optimization procedure. We give results
   for the triangle, where for all degrees d <= 25, we find quadrature
   formulas of this form which have positive weights and contain no points
   outside the triangle. Seven of these quadrature formulas improve on
   previously known results.}},

Journal = {{Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{83-130}},
Abstract = {{This paper is an overview of the finite element methods developed by the
   Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (T{*}AFSM)
   {[}http://www.mems.rice.edu/TAFSM/] for computation flow problems with
   moving boundaries and interfaces. This class of problems include those
   with free surfaces, two-fluid interfaces, fluid-object and
   fluid-structure interactions, and moving mechanical components. The
   methods developed can be classified into two main categories. The
   interface tracking methods are based on the
   Deforming-Spatial-Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized Space-Time
   (DSD/SST) formulation, where the mesh moves to track the interface, with
   special attention paid to reducing the frequency of remeshing. The
   interface-capturing methods, typically used for free-surface and
   two-fluid flows, are based on the stabilized formulation, over
   non-moving meshes, of both the flow equations and the advection equation
   governing the time-evolution of an interface function marking the
   location of the interface. In this category, when it becomes necessary
   to increase the accuracy in representing the interface beyond the
   accuracy provided by the existing mesh resolution around the
   interface,he Enhanced-Discretization Interface-Capturing: Technique
   (EDICT) can be used to to accomplish that Real. In development of these
   two classes of methods, we had to keep in mind the requirement that tilt
   methods need to be applicable to 3D problems with complex geometries and
   that the associated large-scale computations need to be carried out on
   parallel computing platforms. Therefore our parallel implementations of
   these methods are based on unstructured grids and on both the
   distributed and shared memory parallel computing approaches. In addition
   to these two main classes of methods, a number of other ideas and
   methods have been developed to increase the scope and accuracy of these
   two classes of methods. The review of all these methods in our
   presentation here is supplemented by a number numerical examples from
   parallel computation of complex, 3D flow problems.}},

Pages = {{105-125}},
Abstract = {{The fourth generation of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models is
   currently under development at the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)
   consisting of a global grid point model (GME) and limited-area
   Lokal-Modell (LM). The nonhydrostatic fully compressible LM has been
   designed to meet high-resolution regional fore-cast requirements at
   meso-beta and meso-gamma scales. The initial LM implementation is based
   on the NCAR/Penn State MM5 with the addition of a novel generalized
   terrain-following coordinate and rotated lat-lon grid. A fully 3D
   semiimplicit time-stepping scheme has been implemented by retaining the
   full buoyancy term instead of the approximate form found in MM5. In
   contrast with earlier schemes, mass-lumping is not applied to simplify
   the elliptic operator on an Arakawa-C/Lorenz grid. The resulting
   variable-coefficient elliptic problem is solved using a minimal
   residual Krylov iterative method with line relaxation preconditioners.
   The new semi-implicit scheme is compared with a variant of the
   Klemp-Wilhelmson split-explicit scheme (horizontal explicit, vertical
   implicit) on the basis of computational efficiency and accuracy at
   resolutions ranging from 7 km to 400 m. Both idealized 3D mountain wave
   flows and naturally occuring flows are analyzed. Below the tropopause,
   the 3D semi-implicit scheme can be more efficient for low Mach number M
   much less than 1 flows when the number of small time steps Delta t(s)
   of the split-explicit approach increases with the sound-speed Courant
   number.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-implicit and semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin method for
   the shallow water equations is proposed, for applications to geophysical
   scale flows. A non conservative formulation of the advection equation is
   employed, in order to achieve a more treatable form of the linear system
   to be solved at each time step. The method is equipped with a simple
   p-adaptivity criterion, that allows to adjust dynamically the number of
   local degrees of freedom employed to the local structure of the
   solution. Numerical results show that the method captures well the main
   features of gravity and inertial gravity waves, as well as reproducing
   correct solutions in nonlinear test cases with analytic solutions. The
   accuracy and effectiveness of the method are also demonstrated by
   numerical results obtained at high Courant numbers and with automatic
   choice of the local approximation degree. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We present an adaptive discretization approach for model equations
   typical of numerical weather prediction (NWP), which combines the
   semi-Lagrangian technique with a semi-implicit time discretization
   method, based on the Trapezoidal Rule second-order Backward Difference
   Formula scheme (TR-BDF2), and with a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial
   discretization, with variable and adaptive element degree. The resulting
   method has full second-order accuracy in time, can employ polynomial
   bases of arbitrarily high degree in space, is unconditionally stable and
   can effectively adapt the number of degrees of freedom employed in each
   element at runtime, in order to balance accuracy and computational cost.
   Furthermore, although the proposed method can be implemented on
   arbitrary unstructured and non-conforming meshes, even its application
   on simple Cartesian meshes in spherical coordinates can reduce the
   impact of the coordinate singularity, by reducing the polynomial degree
   used in the polar elements. Numerical results are presented, obtained on
   classical benchmarks with two-dimensional models implementing
   discretizations of the shallow-water equations on the sphere and of the
   Euler equations on a vertical slice, respectively. The results confirm
   that the proposed method has a significant potential for NWP
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A high-order, conservative, yet efficient method named the spectral
   volume (SV) method is developed for conservation laws on unstructured
   grids. The concept of a ``spectral volume{''} is introduced to achieve
   high-order accuracy in an efficient manner similar to spectral element
   and multidomain spectral methods. Each spectral volume is further
   subdivided into control volumes, and cell-averaged data from these
   control volumes are used to reconstruct a high-order approximation in
   the spectral volume. Then Riemann solvers are used to compute the fluxes
   at spectral volume boundaries, Cell-averaged state variables in the
   control volumes are updated independently. Further-more, total variation
   diminishing and total variation bounded limiters are introduced in the
   SV method to remove/reduce spurious oscillations near discontinuities.
   Unlike spectral element and multidomain spectral methods, the SV method
   can be applied to fully unstructured grids. A very desirable feature of
   the SV method is that the reconstruction is carried out analytically,
   and the reconstruction stencil is always nonsingular, in contrast to the
   memory and CPU-intensive reconstruction in a high-order k-exact finite
   volume method. Fundamental properties of the SV method are studied and
   high-order accuracy is demonstrated for several model problems with and
   without discontinuities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).}},

Abstract = {{The framework for constructing a high-order, conservative spectral
   (finite) volume (SV) method is presented for two-dimensional scalar
   hyperbolic conservation laws on unstructured triangular grids. Each
   triangular grid cell forms a spectral volume (SV), and the SV is further
   subdivided into polygonal control volumes (CVs) to supported high-order
   data reconstructions. Cell-averaged solutions from these CVs are used to
   reconstruct a high-order polynomial approximation in the SV. Each CV is
   then updated independently with a Godunov-type finite volume method and
   a high-order Runge-Kutta time integration scheme. A universal
   reconstruction is obtained by partitioning all SVs in a geometrically
   similar manner. The convergence of the SV method is shown to depend on
   how a SV is partitioned. A criterion based on the Lebesgue constant has
   been developed and used successfully to determine the quality of various
   partitions. Symmetric, stable, and convergent linear, quadratic, and
   cubic SVs have been obtained, and many different types of partitions
   have been evaluated. The SV method is tested for both linear and
   nonlinear model problems with and without discontinuities. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{An efficient, high-order, conservative method named the spectral

   high-order local representations to achieve conservation and high
   accuracy; and it is based on the finite-difference formulation for
   simplicity. The method is easy to implement since it does not involve
   surface or volume integrals. Universal reconstructions are obtained by
   distributing solution and flux points in a geometrically similar manner
   for simplex cells. In this paper, the method is further extended to
   nonlinear systems of conservation laws, the Euler equations. Accuracy
   studies are performed to numerically verify the order of accuracy. In
   order to capture both smooth feature and discontinuities, monotonicity
   limiters are implemented, and tested for several problems in one and two

Abstract = {{Almost all approaches to solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
   are based upon a spatial discretization of the computational domain-a
   grid. This paper presents an algorithm to generate, store, and traverse
   a hierarchy of d-dimensional Cartesian grids represented by a (k =
   3)-spacetree, a generalization of the well-known octree concept, and it
   also shows the correctness of the approach. These grids may change their
   adaptive structure throughout the traversal. The algorithm uses 2d + 4
   stacks as data structures for both cells and vertices, and the storage
   requirements for the pure grid reduce to one bit per vertex for both the
   complete grid connectivity structure and the multilevel grid relations.
   Since the traversal algorithm uses only stacks, the algorithm's cache
   hit rate is continually higher than 99.9 percent, and the runtime per
   vertex remains almost constant; i.e., it does not depend on the overall
   number of vertices or the adaptivity pattern. We use the algorithmic
   approach as the fundamental concept for a mesh management for
   d-dimensional PDEs and for a matrix-free PDE solver represented by a
   compact discrete 3(d)-point operator. In the latter case, one can
   implement a Jacobi smoother, a Krylov solver, or a geometric multigrid
   scheme within the presented traversal scheme which inherits the low
   memory requirements and the good memory access characteristics directly.}},

   processes in different temporal scales. Sound waves propagate fast
   compared to advective processes. Based on a spatial discretisation on
   staggered grids, a multirate time integration procedure is presented
   here generalising split-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. The advective
   terms are integrated by a Runge-Kutta method with a macro stepsize
   restricted by the CFL number. Sound wave terms are treated by small time
   steps respecting the CFL restriction dictated by the speed of sound.
   Split-explicit Runge-Kutta methods are generalised by the inclusion of
   fixed tendencies of previous stages. The stability barrier for the
   acoustics equation is relaxed by a factor of two.
   Asymptotic order conditions for the low Mach case are given. The
   relation to commutator-free exponential integrators is discussed.
   Stability is analysed for the linear acoustic equation. Numerical tests
   are executed for the linear acoustics and the nonlinear Euler equations.}},

Abstract = {{Shallow water equations with a non-flat bottom topography have been
   widely used to model flows in rivers and coastal areas. An important
   difficulty arising in these simulations is the appearance of dry areas
   where no water is present, as standard numerical methods may fail in the
   presence of these areas. These equations also have still water steady
   state solutions in which the flux gradients are nonzero but exactly
   balanced by the source term. In this paper we propose a high order
   discontinuous Galerkin method which can maintain the still water steady
   state exactly, and at the same time can preserve the non-negativity of
   the water height without loss of mass conservation. A simple
   positivity-preserving limiter, valid under suitable CFL condition, will
   be introduced in one dimension and then extended to two dimensions with
   rectangular meshes. Numerical tests are performed to verify the
   positivity-preserving property, well-balanced property, high order
   accuracy, and good resolution for smooth and discontinuous solutions.

   nonhydrostatic atmospheric simulation and prediction model. Part I:

Journal = {{Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics}},

Pages = {{161-193}},
Abstract = {{A completely new nonhydrostatic model system known as the Advanced
   Regional Prediction System (ARPS) has been developed in recent years at
   the Center for Analysis and prediction of Storms (CAPS) at the
   University of Oklahoma. The ARPS is designed from the beginning to
   serve as an effective tool for basic and applied research and as a
   system suitable for explicit prediction of convective storms as well as
   weather systems at other scales. The ARPS includes its own data ingest,
   quality control and objective analysis packages. a data assimilation
   system which includes single-Doppler velocity and thermodynamic
   retrieval algorithms, the forward prediction component, and a
   self-contained postprocessing, diagnostic and verification package.
   The forward prediction component of the ARPS is a three-dimensional,
   nonhydrostatic compressible model formulated in generalized
   terrain-following coordinates. Minimum approximations are made to the
   original governing equations. The split-explicit scheme is used to
   integrate the sound-wave containing equations, which allows the
   horizontal domain-decomposition strategy to ge efficiently implemented
   for distributed-memory massively parallel computers. The model performs
   equally well on conventional shared-memory scalar and vector
   processors. The model employs advanced numerical techniques, including
   monotonic advection schemes for scalar transport and
   variance-conserving fourth-order advection for other variables. The
   model also includes state-of-the-art physics parameterization schemes
   that are important for explicit prediction of convective storms as well
   as the prediction of Rows at larger scales.
   Unique to this system are the consistent code styling maintained for
   the entire model system and thorough internal documentation. Modern
   software engineering practices are employed to ensure that the system
   is modular, extensible and easy to use.
   The system has been undergoing real-time prediction tests at the
   synoptic through storm scales in the past several years over the
   continental United States as well as in part of Asia, some of which
   included retrieved Doppler radar data and hydrometeor types in the
   initial condition.
   As the first of a two-part paper series. we describe here in the
   dynamic and numerical framework of the model, together with the
   subgrid-scale turbulence and the PBL parameterization. The model
   dynamic and numerical framework is then verified using idealized and
   realistic mountain flow eases and an idealized density current. Other
   physics parameterization schemes will be described in Part II, which is
   followed by verification against observational data of the coupled
   soil-vegetation model, surface layer fluxes and the PBL
   parameterization. Applications of the model to the simulation of an
   observed supercell storm and to the prediction of a real case are also
   found in Part II. In the latter case, a long-lasting squall line
   developed and propagated across the eastern part of the United States
   following a historical number of tornado outbreak in the state of
   Arkansas.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated forecasting and data assimilation system has been and is
   continuing to be developed by the Meteorological Research Branch (MRB)
   in partnership with the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of
   Environment Canada. Part III of this series of papers presents the
   nonhydrostatic formulation and some sample results. The nonhydrostatic
   formulation uses Laprise's hydrostatic pressure as the basis for its
   vertical coordinate. This allows the departure from the hydrostatic
   formulation to be incorporated in an efficient switch-controlled
   perturbative manner. The time discretization of the model dynamics is
   (almost) fully implicit semi-Lagrangian, where all terms including the
   nonlinear terms are (quasi-) centered in time. The spatial
   discretization for the adjustment step employs a staggered Arakawa C
   grid that is spatially offset by half a mesh length in the meridional
   direction with respect to that employed in previous model formulations.
   It is accurate to second order, whereas the interpolations for the
   semi-Lagrangian advection are of fourth-order accuracy except for the
   trajectory estimation. The resulting set of nonlinear equations is
   solved iteratively using a motionless isothermal reference state that
   gives the usual semi-implicit problem as a preconditioner. The
   Helmholtz problem that needs to be solved at each iteration is
   vertically separable, the impact of nonhydrostatic terms being simply a
   renormalization of the separation constants. The convergence of this
   iterative scheme is not greatly modified by the nonhydrostatic
   perturbation. Three numerical experiments are presented to illustrate
   the model's performance. The first is a test to show that hydrostatic
   balance at low resolution is well maintained. The second one is a mild
   orographic windstorm case, where the flow should remain hydrostatic, to
   test that hydrostatic balance at high resolution is also well
   maintained. The third one is a convective case taken from the
   Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment
   (VORTEX). Although these results are encouraging, rigorous testing of
   the model's performance for strongly nonhydrostatic flows still remains
   to be done.}},

   flow}},
Journal = {{Journal of Computational Physics}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{268}},
Pages = {{106-133}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{We present a new adaptive genuinely multidimensional method within the
   framework of the discontinuous Galerkin method. The discontinuous
   evolution Galerkin (DEG) method couples a discontinuous Galerkin
   formulation with approximate evolution operators. The latter are
   constructed using the bicharacteristics of multidimensional hyperbolic
   systems, such that all of the infinitely many directions of wave
   propagation are considered explicitly. In order to take into account
   multiscale phenomena that typically appear in atmospheric flows,
   nonlinear fluxes are split into a linear part governing the acoustic and
   gravitational waves and a nonlinear part that models advection. Time
   integration is realized by the IMEX type approximation using the
   semi-implicit second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2).
   Moreover in order to approximate efficiently small scale phenomena,
   adaptive mesh refinement using the space filling curves via the AMATOS
   function library is employed. Four standard meteorological test cases
   are used to validate the new discontinuous evolution Galerkin method for
   dry atmospheric convection. Comparisons with the Rusanov flux, a
   standard one-dimensional approximate Riemann solver used for the flux
   integration, demonstrate better stability and accuracy, as well as the
   reliability of the new multidimensional DEG method. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We construct uniformly high order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
   schemes which preserve positivity of density and pressure for Euler
   equations of compressible gas dynamics. The same framework also applies
   to high order accurate finite volume (e.g. essentially non-oscillatory
   (ENO) or weighted ENO (WENO)) schemes. Motivated by Perthame and Shu
   (1996) {[}20] and Zhang and Shu (2010) {[}26], a general framework, for
   arbitrary order of accuracy, is established to construct a positivity
   preserving limiter for the finite volume and DG methods with first order
   Euler forward time discretization solving one-dimensional compressible
   Euler equations. The limiter can be proven to maintain high order
   accuracy and is easy to implement. Strong stability preserving (SSP)
   high order time discretizations will keep the positivity property.
   Following the idea in Zhang and Shu (2010) {[}26], we extend this
   framework to higher dimensions on rectangular meshes in a
   straightforward way. Numerical tests for the third order DG method are
   reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A methodology for the automatic mesh generation of quadrilateral
   elements is proposed.  The methodology is based on the facts that (i) a
   region can always be subdivided entirely into quadrilaterals if the
   polygon which forms the boundary of the region has an even number of
   sides, (ii) a quadrilateral can be formed by two triangles which share a
   common side.  By taking advantage of the techniques developed in an
   existing automatic triangular mesh generator, quadrilateral meshes can
   be generated according to the distribution of user specified element
   size over the domain of interest.  In particular, an automatic
   quadrilateral mesh generator based on the advancing front technique for
   triangular mesh generation 1 is described.  Techniques to improve the
   quality of the generated quadrilateral meshes are introduced.  The
   robustness and versatility of the mesh generator are demonstrated by a
   variety of examples.}},
