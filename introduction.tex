\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This document highlights the design specifications for the Machine Learning Atmospheric Model (MLAM). MLAM is a suite of non-hydrostatic atmospheric models required by the Climate Machine  project (\textbf{FXG:Need a new name for the components: e.g., Clima-atmos or CLIMAa?}).  The two non-hydrostatic atmospheric models described are 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) model and 
\item a global model.
\end{enumerate}
This document outlines the details of these two models in terms of 
\begin{enumerate}
\item governing equations  used for both models
\item numerical discretization methods
\item programming language and continuous integration approach.
\end{enumerate}
