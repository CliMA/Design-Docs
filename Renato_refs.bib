@article{VanderTol2009,
abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents the model SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes), which is a vertical (1-D) integrated radiative transfer and energy balance model. The model links visible to thermal infrared radiance spectra (0.4 to 50 $\mu$m) as observed above the canopy to the fluxes of water, heat and carbon dioxide, as a function of vegetation structure, and the vertical profiles of temperature. Output of the model is the spectrum of outgoing radiation in the viewing direction and the turbulent heat fluxes, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. A special routine is dedicated to the calculation of photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll fluorescence at the leaf level as a function of net radiation and leaf temperature. The fluorescence contributions from individual leaves are integrated over the canopy layer to calculate top-of-canopy fluorescence. The calculation of radiative transfer and the energy balance is fully integrated, allowing for feedback between leaf temperatures, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and radiative fluxes. Leaf temperatures are calculated on the basis of energy balance closure. Model simulations were evaluated against observations reported in the literature and against data collected during field campaigns. These evaluations showed that SCOPE is able to reproduce realistic radiance spectra, directional radiance and energy balance fluxes. The model may be applied for the design of algorithms for the retrieval of evapotranspiration from optical and thermal earth observation data, for validation of existing methods to monitor vegetation functioning, to help interpret canopy fluorescence measurements, and to study the relationships between synoptic observations with diurnally integrated quantities. The model has been implemented in Matlab and has a modular design, thus allowing for great flexibility and scalability.},

@article{Hogan2018,
abstract = {Abstract. A fast scheme is described to compute the 3-D interaction of solar radiation with vegetation canopies. The canopy is split in the horizontal plane into one clear region and one or more vegetated regions, and the two-stream equations are used for each, but with additional terms representing lateral exchange of radiation between regions that are proportional to the area of the interface between them. The resulting coupled set of ordinary differential equations is solved using the matrix-exponential method. The scheme is compared to solar Monte Carlo calculations for idealized scenes from the RAMI4PILPS intercomparison project, for open forest canopies and shrublands both with and without snow on the ground. Agreement is good in both the visible and infrared: for the cases compared, the root-mean-squared difference in reflectance, transmittance and canopy absorptance is 0.020, 0.038 and 0.033, respectively. The technique has potential application to weather and climate modelling.},

@article{Jiang2019,
abstract = {Soil background reflectance is a critical component in canopy radiative transfer (RT) models. However, few efforts have been devoted to the development of soil reflectance models compared to other components in canopy RT models. In the spectral domain of soil reflectance, spectral vector models are more flexible than typical spectra models, but its characteristics and performance are poorly understood and validated. To improve the understanding of hyperspectral soil reflectance modeling, this study conducted a comprehensive diagnostic analysis on different spectral vectors derivation algorithms, the impact of training datasets on model performance, and the soil moisture effect in modeling. With improved understanding, a general spectral vectors (GSV) model was developed. The model employs three dry spectral vectors and one humid spectral vector derived from global dry and humid soil reflectance databases including 23,871 soil spectra (400–2500 nm), using a matrix decomposition algorithm. A comprehensive evaluation shows that separate modeling of dry and humid soils and the usage of global training data significantly improved the performance of spectral vectors model, while the choice of spectral vectors derivation algorithm has little influence on model performance. Overall, the GSV model accurately simulates global soil reflectance with an R2 of 0.99 and RMSE of 0.01, superior to the widely-used Price model. In particular, the performance of GSV was robust over various soil types and under different moisture conditions. Coupling with the GSV model substantially reduced errors of 3D and 1D canopy RT modeling. The proposed GSV model has great potentials for vegetation remote sensing studies.},

abstract = {With the launch of NASA's Terra satellite and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), operational Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo products are now being made available to the scientific community. The MODIS BRDF/Albedo algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model and multidate, multispectral data to provide global 1-km gridded and tiled products of the land surface every 16 days. These products include directional hemispherical albedo (black-sky albedo), bihemispherical albedo (white-sky albedo), Nadir BRDF-Adjusted surface Reflectances (NBAR), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The algorithm has been consistently producing albedo and NBAR for the public since July 2000. Initial evaluations indicate a stable BRDF/Albedo Product, where, for example, the spatial and temporal progression of phenological characteristics is easily detected in the NBAR and albedo results. These early beta and provisional products auger well for the routine production of stable MODIS-derived BRDF parameters, nadir reflectances, and albedos for use by the global observation and modeling communities.},
